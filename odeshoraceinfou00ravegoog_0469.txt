The man of boundless wealth possest,
You will not surely rank among
The number of the truly blest3
Such title rather may belong
To him who well and wisely knows
The use of all that God bestows:

Who can endure without a sigh
The bittcr pange of poverty,
And dreads dishonour worse than death ;
Delighting for his friends to live,
Or for his bleeding country give,
If she require, hie breath.

¹ OBSERVATIONS.

This Ode was written in honour of Lollius. He was defeated
by the Sicambri, who invaded Gaul ao. 17. His defeat
caused such alarrn at Rome, that Augustus hurried away to
place himself at the head of his legions on the Upper Rhine.
On his approach the enemy gave hostagea and retired to their
own country. Augustus was too wisc and generous amonareh
to calumniata or forsake a commander because hc had been
unfortunate, and Lollius continued to hold a high place in the
esteem of the Emperor. But he was speedily attached by a
crowd of those mean spirits who are always ready to assail the
nnlncky, and to insuit tho defenceless; and this Ode was
composed to protect the character of a virtuous man from tho
attacks of cowardly slander and depreciation. Tho passage,

¹¹ Non ego te meis
Chattis inornatum silebo,
Totae tuos patiar labores
Impune, Lolli, carpere lividas
Obliviones,’'
