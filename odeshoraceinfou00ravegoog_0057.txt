ODE VII.

ΤΟ MUNATIUS PLANCUS.

Lm* others Rhodes or Mitylene praise‚

Or Delphi verdant with Apollo’s beyn

Or stately Ephesus, or Corinth's pride,

Washed hy th’ AEgean and th' Ionian tide,

Or Thebes by Bacchus loved, or Tempe’s flowery

side :

But some preser to weave the olive erown
Amid the groves of choste Minerva’s town3
While semein J uno’s honour celebrate

Argos for horses famed, and rich Mycenae’s state.
My fancy neither Sparta strikeS, nor grain
Abundant waving on Larissa’s plain,

Like fair Albunea’s Sybilhaunted hall,

By roeky Anio's eehoing waterfall,

And Tibur’p erchardS, and high hanging wood
Refleeted graceful in the whirling flood.

As Notus often clears the sky, nor brings
Perpetual showers upon his eloudy ningo,

Se, Hancne, wisely toste the genial bowl‚
Life’s latest cares and labours to console,
