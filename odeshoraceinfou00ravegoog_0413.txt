BOOK IV.

ODE Ι.

ΤΟ VERUS.

Dosr thou again, 0 Queen of Love l

These long-forgotten transporta move?
Spare me, oh sparo, Ι pray!

The winghd years relentless pase,

Ι am not now what once I was
In Cinara’s blest day.

Ah, cruel! thy seductione oeaee,

And leave my fisty years at peace.

Go where the young with blander prayer
Invoke thy seasonable care 3
Speed on thy purple uirgo,
And join the revellers who come
To Paulus’ hospitable home,
Infliot on him thy stings3
For noble is the youth and kind,
And bloet with pure and generous mind.
