ODE XXIX.

Dnscnnnnn of an ancient line,
That long the Tuscan sceptre swayed,
Make haste to meet the generous wine,
Whose piercing is for thee delayed:
The rosy wreath is ready made ;
And artful hands prepare
The fragrant Syrian oil, that shall perfume thy hair.

When the wine sparkles from afar,
And the well-natured friend eries, Come away ;
Make haste, and leave thy business and thy care ε
N ο mortal int’rest can be worth thy stay.

Leave for awhile thy eostly country-seat3
And, to he great indeed, forget
The nauseous pleasures of the great:

Make haste and come:
