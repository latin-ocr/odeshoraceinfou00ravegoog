ODE V.

Wn used to think the Thunderer reigned supreme
In heaven and earth3 but Caesar now must be
Our chief and present Deity3
Since subject to his rule all nations seem,
From Britain's distant isle to broad Euphrates’ stream.

Hath then the Roman soldier dared
In ties of kindred to unite
With hostile tribes ’gainst whom he warr'd
When Crassus led him to the fight?
And have Apulia’s sons grown grey
In wedlock with an alien wife,
And spent a base, inglorious life
Under the Median tyrant’s sway?
Oh! change unknown, till this degen'rate day!
Forgetful of the noble name
That once they borein battle-field3
Forgetting Vesta's sacred flame,
Forgetting Numa’s heav'ndroptshield-
The robe that Roman matrone wove,
The throne of Capitolian J ove 1
