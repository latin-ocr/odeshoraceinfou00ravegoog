ODE XXXVI.

Tun RETURN OF PLOTIUS NUMIDA.

Now let us haste with sacrifice,
And with the minstrel's jocund train,

To thank tha guardian Deities
That Numida returns from Spain.

who, dear to many fn'ends, with none
More gladly ahares tha fond embrace,

Than with that sweet and cherished one,
Of noble Lamia's ancient raca.

Remembering how, in childhood nurst,
They grew together, till the time
When each attained the toga first,
In all the promise of his prime.

Be this day calendered with white,
And let the wine-jar prompt afford

Its purple stream, and danaers light
Wheel swiftly round the joyous board.
