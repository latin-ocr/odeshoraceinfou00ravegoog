’ ODE VI.

ΤΟ AGRIPPA.

Lm Varius strike the sounding string,
¹ And, soaring on Maeonian wing,

The pomp os victory rehearse

Ambitious in Homerie verse,

And each exploit on sea or land

Achieved by thy resistless band.

My Muse‚ Agfippa, feebler far,

Shrinks from the dire turmoil of war 3⁴

Nor dares Achilles' wrath to sing,

Nor wise Ulysses wandering

Ten years of peril on the brine,

Nor Phrygian Pelops’ guilty line.
Humbly she leaves to other lyres

High thoughts that kindle Epic fireS,
And hesitates with conscious shame

To tarnish thine and Caesar's fame.
