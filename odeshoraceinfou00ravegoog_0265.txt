The martyr to his country dies
A sweet and glorious death ;
Fate strihes the coward as he thee,

Nor heeds the tender stripling’s eries,
Nor speres his craven breath.

Virtue‚ superior to defeat,

With unstained honour shines3
And neither clairns the consul's seat,
N or awed by Faction’s vulgar threat,

Her dignity resigns.

Virtue, to such as Death defy,

To heaven points out the rond 3
And spurning the dnmp earth, on high
Aspires to immortality‚

And seeks repose with God.

Diseretion too her meed shall bear3
With one that could betray

The myst’ries of Eleusis, ne’er
Would 1 consent my roof to share,

Or tempt the watery way.
