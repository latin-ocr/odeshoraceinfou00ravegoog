The ghosts‚ in shadowy groups arrayed
Around the minstrel and the maid

In sacred silence throng3*
But more the vulgar love the sound

Of bloody feuds and kings uncrowned,
And Faction’s maddening song.

The hundred-headed monster hears,

And couering down his ravished ears,
Avows the strain divine;

The snakes that wreethe the Furies' hair

Terence refreshed, upon their leir
Their scaly lengths untwinc.

Prometheus' vulture steps his meal,
And Pelops' sire forgets te feel
His crevings dire for f00d3

Nor does Orien care te truce
The brindled lion in the chase,
Or reuse the lynx's brood.
