ODE Ι.

ΤΟ MAEcuNAs.

On thou, whose line illustrious springs
From old Etnn‘ia's hero kings, ⁴
Maecenas 1 patron friend and guido,

What various aims mankind divide !

One loves to chive, with seourge and rein,
The chariot o'er Olympia’s plain 3

And when his glowing axle rolls

In triumph past successive gozelo,

The palm of conquest waving near

Lista him beyond this nether sphere.
This man the mob's applause can raise
To rupture by their fickle praise:
Another covets for his stores

'she grain of Libya's threshing·floors :—
Him who expends his daily toil

In ploughing his paternal soil,

No prospects of unbounded gain

Can tempt upon the treacherous main.
