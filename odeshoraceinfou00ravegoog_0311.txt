Leave to the State ite cares 3-0ne foe
Hath fallen in Daoian Cotiso.

The Mede, perplexed with civil etrife‚
Athis own bosom aime the knife3
The fieroe Cantabrian wears our chain,
At length imposed on rebel Spain ;
And with lax bow the Scythians rude
Fly to their northern solitude.

Then, ifat ease on state affairs,

Why vex youreelf with private cares?
Forget sad things and maxims seur,
And snatoh with joy the present hour.

OBSERVATIONS.

A long story might be written in reference to the obser-
vanoe oi the Kalends oi March. Suffioe it to say, that married
people oelebrated the reason by sacrifices. Horace, who was a
bacheler, explains to Maeeenae hia reason for celebrating the
day with a votive offering, and invites his friend and patron
to anpper, bidding him eaohew politice, and forget aare in the
present enjoyment.

Marah, 1851.
