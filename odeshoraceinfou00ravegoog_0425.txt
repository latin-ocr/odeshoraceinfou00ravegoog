402 renonnsor noanon. noox ιν.

Βοι mine a new-weaned steer
That wantons in the verdant mead
With tawny hide, and butting head,
On whose broad frontlet is displayed
A crescent white and clear,
Such as the young moon traces bn‘ght
Upon the dusky vault of night.

OBSERVATIONS.

Iulus Antonius is said ιο have esked Horace ιο celebrate
the recent victorico os Augaeus over the Sicambrisn tribes in
sPindario Ode. Horace declines the task npon the plea of
deficient powers, and tells his friend that he con do it better
himself:-

“ Concines majore Poeta plectro
Caesarem.”

Wbetever may bave been the trnecanse of Horace’s refusal,
thero can be no doubt thot be who could so noll describe the
powers end peculicr beanties of Pindar could have rivallod
all the varied excellcnoes os the Greek Lyrist if be had
thought fit to make tho attempt. In trutb, he rises up ιο tho
samo level even while plccding his own inferiority.
