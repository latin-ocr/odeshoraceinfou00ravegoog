Man, feeble man, but little knows

From honr to hour what secret foes,
What dangers round him wait3
The sailor trembles at the roar
Of breakers on a rooky shore,
Nor dreads elsewhere his fate.

’ The soldier fears the vengeful ssight
Of Parthian squadrons in the light,
The Parthian unconfined
Abhors and dreads the Roman yoke 3
But Death‚ with swist and sudden stroke, ·
Still decimales mankind.

*How near those dismal courts Ι saw

Where AEacus pronounces law
And Pluto holds his state3

And those Elysian realms of rest,
Abodes decreed of spirits blest
By everlasting Fato.

Those happy shades‚ where Sappho sings
Complaining on AEolic strings

Of liery Passion’s blight3
And where upon his golden shell
Aleaeus' chords more loudly tell

Of shipwreck, war, and flight.
