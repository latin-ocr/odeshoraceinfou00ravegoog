“ Am 1 awake? or doth a dream
“ F mih issuing from the ivory door
“ Os Somnus, by enchantment seem
“ T’ invent the crime that Ι deplore,
“ And ask in soom which happier lot was mine
“ To cull the springing flowers or swim the brine?
“ Could I but see that bull abhorr’d,
“ 1'd stab him with the vengeful swerd,
“ And from his fotehead crushed and rent
“ I'd break the horns on which I leant.
‘⁴ Shameless 1 left my father's home,
“ Shameless delay my pending doom.
“ Ye Gods! who witness my despair,
“ These naked limbs let lions tear 1
“ Alas! before gaunt Famine come
“ To wither up my youthful bloom,
‘⁴ Exhaust my veina, and ehill my blood,
“ I'll seed the tiger’s rav'ning broodi
‘⁴ Ι hear my absent father cry, ⁷
“ ‘ Oh, worthless child! dost fear to die?
“ ‘ Go hang thyself from yonder tree,
‘⁶ ‘ Thy girdle still is left to thee,

ιι ι 01· headlong plunge from yon sharp 1⁸00k
“ ‘ (If thou prefer a speedier shoch),

“ ‘ And trust once more thy tender form

“ ‘ To th' mercy of the howling storm3

“ ⁶ Or peradventure wilt thou choose

“ ‘ A menial’s service, nor refuse
