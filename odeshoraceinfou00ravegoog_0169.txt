ODE Ι.

ΤΟ ASINIUS POLLIO.

Tnn civil conflicta from Metellus’ time,

The cause of war, its conduct, and its crime 3
The sport of Fortuna and the ill that springs
From the false friendships of intriguing kings,
And arms yet red with unatonhd gore

(A task of perilous chance) you ponder o’er‚
And walk on fires that smoulder ’neath a crust
Of cindcrs hardly cool, and treacherous dust.
Yet for awhilo your varied labour close,

And give the Tragic Muse a brief repose 3
Conclude th' historian's office first, and then,
Oh, Pollio! seek the theatre again.

Thou to the trembling culprit justly dear,
Whose voice deliberating Senates hear3

To whom of late Dalmatian triumphs spread
Unfading laurels round your honoured head.
Lo! as we rcad our ears now seem to thrill
With clanging trumpetS, or with hugles shrill;
And now the flashing armour checks the course
Of charging chivalry and panting horse.
