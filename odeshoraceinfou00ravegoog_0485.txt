Whither hath Venus fledl ah, where
The tint of rose, the graceful air?
What now remains of her—of her
Who breathed Love's sweetest atmosphere,
And tore me from myself away,
Dearest by far sinae Cinara's day?
But cruel Fate to Cinara gave

A brilliant youth, an early grave,
While ancient Lyce’s long career
Rivals the raven’s hundredth year3
That onr hot-blooded youth may see,
Not without jest and ribaldry‚

The Toreh in ashes foul expired,
Which in ita blaze they once admired.

May 11, 1853.
