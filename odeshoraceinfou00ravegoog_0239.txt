Whether the Libra’s milder sign,
Or Scorpio's influence malign
Beheld my natal hour;
Or Capricornus' angny star
That rulcs th’ Hesperien wave asar
Had then ascendant power,
Our destiny hath true consent
In planet and in clement:
The guardian hand of Jove
Snatched thee from Saturn's grasp of late,
And checked the rapid wings of Fate
With all a father's love,
When multitudes assembled rose at once
ι And gave the joyflnl tidings glad response.
A tree which fell upon my head
Me too had levelled with the dcad;
But nimble Faunus, who thinks fit
Το guard from danger men of wit,
Stretched felth his hand 'twixt me and Fate,
And robbed the blow of half its weight.
Do thou, Maecenas, not neglect
To pay thy God his due respect;
But bid the votive Temple rise
With incense flaming to the skies:
I'll lead a lamb to sactifice.
