ODE XXX.

I’vn reared a goodly monument
Than wall of brass more permanent,
Whose lolty pinnaele outbids

The fame of Egypt’s Pyramids,
Which neither tempest can assail,
Nor pining show’r, nor driving hail,
Nor change of seas0n‚ nor the ssight
Of ages yet unnumbered blight.

Ι shall not altogether die l

My better part shall death defy,
And to remote posterity

Bequeath an honourable name,
Rich with accumulated fame3

So long as J ove's almighty hand
The sceptre holds o’er sea and land,
And Pontiffs with their virgin train
Aecend the Capitolian Fane.
