ODE ΙΙΙ.

ΤΟ DELLIUS.

Damus! since all are bom to die,
Remember, in adversity,
To show thyself resigned ;
Nor less when Fortune's favouring gale
Impels thy bark with ewelling sail,
Maintain a placid mind.

Whether relentless Care hath cast

Her gloomy shadows o’er the past,
Or Indolenoe and Ease

Have seen thee woo the vernal wind

And quaff the purple grape‚ reclined
Beneath the waving trees;

where the tall pine and poplar white
Their mingled foliage unite
In hospitable shade3
And where the struggling rivulet
In rocky channel seems to fret·
Its winding course delayed.
