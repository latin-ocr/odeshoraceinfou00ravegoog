But rather would have dared to alay
Troy'e captive sons in open day,
= And in his mad unhallowed ire

Had cast upon the flaming pyra
Dnmb infanta and the babe unbom
From its dead mother’s entrails torn 3
Unless the Sire of Gods by prayer
Of thine o’ercome, and Venus fair,
To great AEneas had decreed
The lot a chosen few to lead,
And under happier star to found
The walls of Troy on Latian ground.
O Phoebus, that didst once inspire
With soul of song the' Greeian Lyre,
And lov’st thy flowing looks to lave
In sacred Xanthus’ golden wave3
Smooth·cheeked Agyieus, hear my prayer, Ι
And make the Daunion Muse thy care:
Thou gavest me the tunefnl art,
A poet’s name, a poet’s heart.

Youths and maidens fair and young

From illustrious parents sprung ;

By the Goddess loved‚ whose smile
Beams on Delos' favonred Isle,
Pieroing with her deadly dart
Keen·eyed lynx and antlered hart3
Mark the Lesbian measures well,
Where they fall·and where they swell‚
