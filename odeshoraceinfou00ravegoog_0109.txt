Plaee me within that frozen zone,
Upon whose fields no tree is grown,
Where driving clouds and tempests drear

Deform the melancholy year3

Plaee me beneath the tropic sun,

Where houseless men in deserto run,
The softly speaking Lalage,
The softly smiling still for me.

Ι suppose that of all the Odes of Horace this has been
most frequently translated. Itis so pretty, so easy to be
understood, so short and so expressive, that every youthful
poet is tempted to select it aa a first experiment. Yet Ι
doubt if any one have succeeded in conveying the full
sweetness of the last lines,-

“ Duloe ridentem Lalagen amabo,
Dulce loquentem.”

Ι confess my own failure, which is the more humiliating,
after having tried every conceivable variety of form for twenty

years.
