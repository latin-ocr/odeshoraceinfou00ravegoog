Or when he strikes the lyric stringe
In praise of Gods and Hero Kings,
Who dragged the Centaur’s rage to death,
And quenehed Chimaera's flaming breath ;
Or tells of those who homet ret urn
Victorious from Olympia’s game,'
Whoso in wrestling or the raee
Have gained the foremost place
And won the wreath of Fame;
Or if the gentle youth he mourn
From weeping bride and kindred torn,
Extol his valour to the sky,

Such acts as plead for longer breat h,
And virtues that we grudge to Death.
High soars the Theben swan,
And wantons in the traete of cloud
Wit h tehantings clear and lond!
thst I my Antony‚ still labour on
Assiduous like the Matine bee,
That eulls the wild· ·'thymes opening flower
Round the moist glades of Tivoli3
Thus through the noontide hour,
In sunshine or in shower‚
The solitary groves among
I humbly weave th' elaborated song.
