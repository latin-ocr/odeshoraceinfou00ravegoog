Thus Hercules in realms above

sits st the board of Sovereign Jove.
Thus the twin stars of Leda save

The shattered vessel from the vave,

And thus the vine-crowned God bestows
A hlessing on his votary's vovvs.

OBSERVATIONS.

In this Ode to Censorinus Horace gives due honour to the
poet's calling, ond boldly proelsims the velue os his own verse.
Unfortnnately‚ we have not the means to determine for our-
selves the justice of the honours levished by Horoee on the
Muse of Ennius. Τὴο verses os that Roman Ohsuoer no
longer “fly through men's mouths.'’

Anu es, 1853.
