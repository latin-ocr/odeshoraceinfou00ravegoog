What though you level landmarlrs, and confound
All ancient limits on your olients' ground ;
Men, wives, and children from their dwellings torn,
Their household Gods within each bosom borne,
Unpitied wonder from their ruined door

To beg the suoeour that they gave before 3-
And yet bethink thee, that no surer doom
Awaits the spoiler than th’ insatiate tomb.
What wild desires are thino! th' impartial grave
Yawns wide alike for tyrant and for slave.
Death‚ called or unealled, weleomed or abhorred,
Triumphant reigns an universal lord.

Death strikes the nise, the wealthy‚ and the bold,
Derides their oourage and rejects their gold;
Steeps in oblivion's stream the moumer’s woes
And lulls the labourer to a long repose.

OBSERVATION S.

Α kindly spirit of contentmont and goodness pervadas this
Ode. rHo sansures pride and extravaganee‚ reminding the
rich and powerful of this world that the same destiny awaits

the pauper and tho children of kings.
The latter port of this version must ho viowod rather as a

paraphrase than a translation in tho striot sense of the term.
