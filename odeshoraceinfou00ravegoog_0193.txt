ODE VII.

TO POMPEIUS VARUS.

Ι Pomnr! my earliest friend, who ost with me
In days of yore hast drawn the sword
When Brutus fought and bled for liberty ;
What happy chance hath now restored

Thee to thy country’s guardian Deities,
Thy Rome beloved and thine Italian skies?
How oft with thee in tipsy play
Have I beguiled the tedious day,
Wreathing with flowers our glossy hair
Perfumed with Syrian unguenta rare!
With thee I fled Philippi’s field,
Casting aside my oravon shield
When patriot valour strove in vain,

And fallen heroes bit the plain.
Me did swist Mercury enshroud

All trembling in a foggy cloud,
While theo the wavo of battle's flood

Swept back again to blows and blood.
Wherefore pay offerings due to Jove,
Reposing in my laurel grove

Thy wearied frome from warfare free,
Nor spara the cask reserved for thee.
