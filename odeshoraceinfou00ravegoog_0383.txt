ODE XXVI.

TO VENUS.

Tm, lately not unept for love

From fair to fair I used so reve,
In amorous conflict bold 3

But now Ι hang upon the wall

My lute unstrung and weapons all
Grown useless, blunt, and old.

Here in thy temple Ι resign
Bright Venus, every gift of thine,
My glory once and joy ε

The blazing torah, th’ unerring bow,
And elubs that broke with eager blow
The deors of maidens eoy.
