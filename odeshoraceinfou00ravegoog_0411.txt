Ι shall be known in future ages,

Where Aufidus’ wild torrent rages,

And where th' Apulian Daunus reigns
With scanty stream 0’er flocks and swains,
As he, who born of low degree,

Clairned a high place in minstrelsy,

The first to teach his native tongue

The measures 01 AEolic song.

Then‚ Flaccus, take thine honours due,
With pride th' accomplished labour view,
And thou 1 Melpomene, reward

With crown 01 Delphic bays thy Bard.
