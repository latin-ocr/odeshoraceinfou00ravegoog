ODE XI.

ν ⁶ ΤΟ MERCURY.

On, Meroury 1 who didst inspiro

Amphion's strain thot stones oould move 3
And thou, my seven-ohorded Lyre,

Skilled to attone the notos of love3

Not then admired‚ ao now thou ort,
In holy fanos or rich men's feast3
Oh, say, what numbers can impono
Some warmth to Lydia's frozen breost?

Like a young mare in heedloss raoe
She bounds exulting o'er the plain ;
But coyly shrinks from love’s embraoe,
And spurns the yoke and flios the rein.

Thy oharm the tigon's noge oon quoll,
The rushing torrent's speed delay3
Entranoed by thee, the dog of hell
Crouohed down and oeasod his angny bay.
