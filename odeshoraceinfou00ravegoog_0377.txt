Or cheats his guest, and thus prepares

A fortune for his worthless heire,

And wealth dishonourably won
Accumulates from sire to son.

Yet certain things, I know not what,
Seem ever absent from the lot

Of those, who measuring wealth by want,
Still find their fortune somewhat scant.

OBSERVATION S.

We find iu this Ode a sort of homily npon the abuse of
riches, or rather upon the indulgence of the vice oi covetous-

ness which brings in its train such evils upon society. Pre-
serable, says the Poet‚ is the lot of those wild tribes 'that

inhabit the desert, that know not even tha use of wealth, bnt
who preserve in their shifting tents primitive virtues and
nnstained chastity. Then follow some noble lines as to the
dnties and authority of princes, and in what manner a rnler
may deservo to be styled the “ Father ol Cities.”

The Poet then laments the degradation oi morale, the
degeneracy of youth, and the criminal examples ol maturer
age: nor does he leave unreproved the dishonest gains of
commerce; forto thesc only can be fairly applied those lines
which appear to cast a general censure upon that spirit os
enterprise which carries the trader into all quarters of the globe.

He concludes with a very quaint sentence:—“ Thus,”
ho says, “ and by such means do vile riches growand increase3
but yet it must be owned there is a something, a ‘je ue spots
quil which is always wanting, ‘curta rei.'”

The precise meaning of this sentence seems to me doubtful.
Tho interpretation hcrc given is rather in obediente to au-
thority than the result ol my own convictione.
