ODE IX.

. TO LOLLIUS.

Tama not tha words shall e'er be lost
Which I, by Daunia’s torrent reared

( A wild and brawling stream), may boaat,
In numbers yet untold‚ unhoard,

T’ have bid the Latian Musa rehearse
In measures of AEolio verse.

Not though Maeonian Homer claim

The highest placa, shall night obscure
Inimitable Pindar’s fame 3

And still Alcaeus’ throats endure,

And still the Cean Musa is known?
And the Sicilian's graver tone.†

The sallies of Anacreon's page
Shall still the sportivo fancy move “
Of happy youth from age to age 3
And still the soul of plaintive love
Broathas on the chorda of Sappho's lyre,
Rekindling her impassioned firo.

¹⁶ Simonides. Τ Stesichorus,
