ODE Χ.

On rich in all the gista of love,
And amelin thy sovereignty of ohanna!
When time that pride of beauty shall remove
And from thy snowy neck and arma
The looks that now luxuriant flow
Shall fall away l
And that rich hue which rivals rosas now
Shall quit its wonted place,
⁴ And leave a dry and withered oheek 3
Then shall you say
When in the glass your former self you seeh
And find an altered face,
“ Woe's me 1
“ Why had Ι not in youth the wishes of today
“ And warm desires?

‘⁶ Or why return no charms 1ο match my present fires?”
Sanncna Pnncnvnn.
