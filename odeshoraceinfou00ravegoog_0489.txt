Conspicuous in the martial fray

What ghastly ruin marked his way

When urging on his maddened horse
Against the foeman's ohivalry,

Through blood and flnme he held his course,
Aa Auster rides the raging sea

Beneath the Pleiad's stormy light,

That oleaves the rolling clouds in bleak November'a
night. “

When swoln with rain his torrenta sweep
'Past Daunia’s realm impetuous,
Threatening the ripened grain and sheep
That graze upon his yielding banks;
So Claudius the barbarian ranke,
Though closely wedged and iton-bound,
With might resistleas scattered round,
And mowed down front and rear heaped on the erimson
ground ;

Himself unhurt! for thou hadst given

The warrior band, the counael suge,
The favour of propitious Heaven

That smiles upon th' Augustan age 1
Since from that memorable day

When Alexandria oped her gates
And did her vacant halls display,

For lustres three the kindly Fates
