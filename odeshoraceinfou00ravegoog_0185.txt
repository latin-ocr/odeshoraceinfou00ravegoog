ODE V.

Non yet is thy young heifer broke
Το bend her frontlet fair
Obedient to the galling yoke,
Or drag the cumbrous share;
N or may her tender loins endure the weight
And rude embraces of her ardent mate.

The grassy mend is her delight,
Where gelid fountains burst

Forth from some roek’s impending height
Το slake her raging thirst3

Among the osiers now she loves to stray,
And sport with frisking calves the livelong day.

Oh, pluch not thou in early spring
. The grape all green and sour,
When glowing Antumn soon shall bring
His purple-tinted store;
And many a ripened cluster heaped on high
shall tempt thine appetite and charm thine eye.
