BOOK ΠΙ.

ODE Ι.

Ι nm and seorn the vulgar throng!
Give ear, oh, Romans, to my song!
Priest of the Muses' quire,
My ehords awake a loftier sound,
While youths and maidens list’ning round,
Applaud the varied lyre.

Behold the monareh's state revered,

And envied by the subject herd;
While monarehs prostrate fall

Before great J ove’s celestial face
Triumphant o'er the giant rece,

And sov'reign lord of all.

One man may plant a wider plain
With teeming vines, another gain
The people’s flathering cheers3
A third, with more exalted aim
In morale, industry‚ and fame,
Excel his young eompeers.
