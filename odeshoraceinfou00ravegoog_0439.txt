OBSERVATIONS ro Ona IV.

This magnificent Ode was compostel in honour of Drusus
Nero, the step-son of Augustus, who was born in the Em-
peror's palaea three months after his marriage with Livia
He and his elder brother Tiberius, afterwards tho infamous
Emperor, were educated together. Adopted by Augustus
and descended from the great Claudian family, their youthful
promise amply justified the high hopes indulged by the Poet.
“ Dis aliter visum;” for Drusus died at the early age of
thirty by a fall from his horse, and liberius has left behind
him the most execrable character in history.

The Ode commences with two glorious similes, under the
type of which the youthful conqueror of the Rhoetion and
Vindelician tribea is appropriately introduced.

After some nervous stanzas, alluding to the paternal care
which Augustus had bestowed in the education of these two
noble youths, the Poet reminds the Roman people of the
traditionary honours aad prowesa of their race, especially
displayed at the battle of the Metaurus, where Claudius Nero
defeated and slew Asdrubal with immense loss,-a victory
which, in all probability, was the salvation of Rome, by pre-
venting the J unction of Asdrubal’s army with that of Hannibal.

The Ode concludes with an imaginary soliloquy of the
Carthaginien leader in language here and there very difficult
to be perfectly understood :—

“ Cervi, luporum praeda rapacium,
sectamur ultro quos opimus . ι
Fallere et effugere est triumphus.¹'

I hope I have giren this phrase its right meaning, but it
seems strange to talk of stags pursuing the wolvcs which prey
upon them.

Another passage in this Ode has been the srrbject of much
