To PYBREA.

Wum· youth, Ο Pyrrha ! bloomiug fair,

With rose-twined wreath and perfumed hair,

Wuos thee beueath yon grotto’s shade,

Urgent in prayer and moruus glauce?
For whom dost thou thy tresses braid,

Simple in chine elegance ¹?

Alasl full soon shall he deplere

Thy broken saith, thino altered mian :
Like une astonished at the rom·

Of breakers on a leeward shore,

Whom gentle airs and skies serene
Had tempted on the treachemus deep,
So he thy perfidy shall weep
Who now enjoys thee fair and kind,
But dreams not os the shisting wind.
