[old. My breast with fond desire
For youthful Calais burns;
Touched with a mutual fire,
The son of Ornithns my love returns ;
For him Γᾶ doubly die with joy,
So Heaven would spere my Thurian boy.

Hor. What, ifthe former chain
That we too rashly broke,
We yet should weave again,
And bow oneo more beneath th' aoeustomed yoke?

If Chloe's swayno morel own,
And Lydia fill the vaeant throne?

Iosd. Though bright as morning-star
My Calais' beaming brow3
Though more inconstantior,

And easier chafed than Adria’s billows thou3
With thee my life I'd gladly spend‚
Content with thee that life to end.

OBSERVATIONS.

This beautiful Dialogue and Palinodia has deservedly been
always esteemed one of tha most perfect compositions extant.
Ibelieve 1 may salely affirm that thia version hythe noble
Earl, whose name graoes the page, accurately ronders for tho
benefit os the English render the beauty and spirit of tho
original latin. Groater praise than this cannot ho awarded.
