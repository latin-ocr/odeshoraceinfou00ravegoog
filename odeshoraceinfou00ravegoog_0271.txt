When J uno ‚rising from the oouoh of Jove,

Addressed the eonolave of the Gods above: ·—
“Oh, Ilion! one foul doed of lust,

“ Thy weak adulterous prinoe’s shame,

“ Linked with a foreign Spartan dame,

“ Crombled thy town and towers to dust!

“ A fate foredoomed by the deoree

“ Of ohasto Minerva aad of me,

‘⁴ To all thy people, altars, throne,

“ From that day when Laomedon

“ Cheoting the heavenly builders‚ dared

“ Deprive them of their pledged reward!

“ Thy proud, but sin-polluted dome,

“ The Spartan strumpet’s second home,

“ No longer flourisheth, no more

‘⁶ Doth Hector swell the battle’s roar,

“ And with his perjured kin unite

“ To triumph or to fall in fight.

“ The war, by our dissensione fed,

“ Now elumbem with the mighty dead;

“ And Ι remit the oherished wrong

“ That rankled in my bosom long,

“ And willingly to Mars resign

“ The grandson of that hated line3

“ Here let him sit in Juno’s sight,

“ And tread the stany halis of light,
“ The nectar quaff in eups of gold

“ With Gods and Demigods enrolled.
