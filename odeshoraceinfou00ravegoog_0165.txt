OBSERVATIONS.

This glorions Ode is n song of triumph ior the loll of

Cleopatra, If the poet libels the memory of thot dissolute
but high-spirited queen, when he tulhs of her “Mentem
lymphatam Mareotioo,” he does justice to her heroism end
contage in the oonelnding stunzas. Α

Snbjoined is another more regular end probably fer better
version, by my noble friend the Enrl ol' Dnnnr.

Feb. 1841.

Dn'nlr we now, und dunning round,
Press with footsteps free the ground ;
Ponr we now the rosy wine,
And, in honour of the Gods,
Oomrudes, iu their own ubodes

Pile we the bouquet on esch holy shrine.

Sin it were ere now to pour
Forth the cellar’s generons store;
While the henghty Queen of Nile,
With herboso and sourvy oren,
Dored nnbridled to pnrsne
Wild hopes, and drunk with Fortnne's fevonring smile,

Modly drenmed the Capitol
Soon should totter to its fall,
And the Empire’s sels should die ;
But her spirit qnailed awhile,
When of all the ships of Nile
From Romo’s evenging fires scaros one eould fly.
