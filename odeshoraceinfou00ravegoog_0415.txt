He riehly stored with liberal ants
Thy chains shall bind o'er captive heans,
And spread thy trophies wide3
And if he smile‚ by thee made bold,
..Triumphant o’er his rival’s gold,
On Lake Albano’s side
Thy marble form shall stand portrayed,
With beams of cedar overlaid.

Nor shall the mingled strain be mute
Of Lyre, and Berecynthian fluia,
When youths and virgins round,
Led by the Salian priest shall green
Thy name, and tread with snowy feet
In choral danee the ground3
While incense steaming to the skies
Attests the bloodless sacrifice.

Me neither gentle woman’s love,

Nor that fond ered'lous hope ean move,
Which wanns each mutual v0w3

No more the jolly task be mine

To pass around the flowing wine,
Or wreathe with flowers my brow.

Yet why, Corinna, tell me why

Do silent tears bedew mine eye?
