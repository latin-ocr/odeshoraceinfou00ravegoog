176 Tne ones oe nomon. BOOK 11.

Resides, each day augments your train,
Each hour your charms new slaves enchain;
Nay‚ even those who late forswore

Your roos, still linger round the door.

Thee mothers for their striplings dread,
Old men, and virgins lately wed,

Lest thine elluring air delay

The Bridegroom on his homeward way.

OBSERVATIONS.

Iheve little doubt that Barine felt consoled for Horaee's
attacks upon her perjury and deceit by the eompliments paid
to her beauty end attractione.
