Each husbandman, ere daylight ende,
Along the widowed elms suspends

'Neath his own hills the vine;
Then turns him home and drinks to thee,

His best and chiefest Deity,
In cups of home-brewed wine.

To thee he dedicates the bowl,
To thee in prayer pours out his soul,
And with each household Lar
Mingles thy name, as ancient Greeoe
Adored her hero Hercules,
And Castor's beaming star.

Oh worthy of all love and praise‚ ¹

Long may’st thou grant such holiday5‚
To us thy subjecte blest;

On thee we call at morning prime,

And in our cups at even time,

When Sol hath sunk to rest.
