Yet Care attends increasing store, ἱ
Mueh gain provoking thirst for more; Ι
And 1, Maecenas, justly dread i
To raise aloft my laurelled head ‘t

Conspicuous o'er the crowd. ¹·
The more a man to self denies Ι·
The more kind Providenee supplies3 i
And I, in poverty, have sought ι
The eamps of those who eovet nought,

Leaving the rich and proud‚

Lord of mine own, more blest perehanee
In that despised inheritanoe,
Than if Ι swept from golden fields
The harvest that Apulia yields
With vast possessione poor.
A shody grove and vineyard near,
Watered hy mountain streamlet clear
More bliss bestow‚ than if my reign
Stretehed far and wide o'er Afrie's plain
To Nilus' teeming shore.

What though no hives are stored for me

With produco of Calabrian hee,

Nor melloweth in my jars the wine

Rich pressed from Laestrygonian vine,
Nor flochs from distant Gaul

Breed in my pastures,—from my door

Stern want is absent3 and if more
