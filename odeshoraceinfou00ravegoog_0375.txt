Lo! neither oon the scorohing drowth
Of Libyan doserts to the South,

Nor forthest Thulo’s icy coast
Environed by the Polor frost

Deter tho merchant, for his gain
O’erooming the tempestuous main !
So keen o sting hath Poverty

Thot goads him thus t’ ondure or die,
And bids him quit stern Virtue's rood
To worship gold, his only God.

We may forsooth resolve to throw
Beneath tho woves that ebb and How,
Or pour into the Capitol

Whero shouting mobs and triumphs call,
Wholo storo of gold ond jewels, still
The source and cause of all our ill—
Yet vain such sacrifico to win

Tho beart from its besetting sin i

The elemento we must first eraso

Of every passion vilo and base,

And elevate tho mind of youth

To higher aim and nobler truth.

The ingenuous boy untaught to guido
His pranoing palfroy, fears to ride,
More knowing he to make his bet
And win ot hasard, or roulette!

The moro experienoed fathor's guile
Defrouds his bosom fiiend the while,
