Thes to the reulms of Pluto borne,

conspicuous with thy golden horn,
Grim Cerberus adored,

To thy departing footsteps clung,

Coressed thee with his triple longus,
And owned thee for his lord.

OBSERVATIONS.

This Ode, in honour of Bocchus, hus been supposed by
some to contsin remote snd mysterious allusione. The Indisn
Bocchus und his schievemcnts have been associated in the
minds of those commentatore to whom Ι allude, with the great
legislator os the Jews, and tho miracles which hc wrought
during the fortyyeurs’ wandering in the desert. Msny singu·

· lsr snslogics hsvc been pointed ont by the ingenuity of thess
drcumers ; but ss it would sccm impossible to connect all the
attributes of Bacchus in this Odc with those of Moses, one
may bo permitted to refusc assent to the alleged identity.

of snothor point I hsvo no doubt; nnmely‚ thet Tition
lmd this Ode in his mind when he composed and pointed tho
celebrated picture in our N stionul Gsllery‚ osllsd in the Cotu-

loguss “ Ths Triumph ol Bocchus.”
