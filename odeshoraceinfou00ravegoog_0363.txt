By gentle violence you subdue

The harshest natures‚ and with you
The wise forget their care,

Unburthen ost their inmost soul

In sweet communion o’er the bowl,
And mutual seorets share.

To the worn frame and anxious breast

Yon bring baoh hope and offer rest3
You bid the oringing poor

Exalt his horn above the fear

Of tyrant’s erown or soldier’s spear
With strength unknown before.

Thee Bacchus and fair Venus ehoose;

And the sweet Graees who refuse
Their bond to disunite3

Thy joys the oandle's living fire

Shall still prolong, till stars retire
Before'the dawning light.

OBSERVATIONS.

In this poetioal sddress to his wine-jer he invites Messala
Corvinus, 1 man greve and dignified end versed in the learning
of the sohools‚ to pertske of his hospitality-showing by the
example of Cato that the severest natures may be relexed,
and the worst oeres of life mitigeted, hy rational indulgence.
The phrase “addis oornue'' will be noted as identioel with
many expressions in Holy Writ of the same meaning. Bacchus
himselfis represented in 1 former Ode 11 “Aureo cornu dooorus.”
