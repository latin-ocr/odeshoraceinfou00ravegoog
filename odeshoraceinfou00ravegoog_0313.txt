ODE IX.

TO LYDIA.

Horace. Wflmo I was dear to thee,
While with encireling arms
No youth preferred to me

Dared to profane thy bosom's snowy cherms;
I envied not, by thee adored,

The wealth, the bliss of Persie's lord.

Iosdio. While all thy bosom glowed
With love for me alone ;
While Lydia there abodo,

Where Chloe now hes fixed her hateful throne ;

Well pleased, our Roman Ilia's fame
I deemed eclipsed by Lydia's name.

Hor. ’Tis true, my captive heart
The sair-haired Chloe swayS,
Skilled with transcendentem
To touch the lyre, and breatho harmonious lays:
For her my life were gladly paid,
So Hoeven would spare my Cretan maid.
