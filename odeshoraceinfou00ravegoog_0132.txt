Ossaavsrrous (corstinaed).

“ Metamorphoses,’' which Ι find is also cited in the notes of
Francis’s version :—

(Prrmoorus loquitur.)

‘⁸ Ipse ego, uam memini, Trojani tempore belli
Panthoides Euphorbus eram, oui pectore quondam
Haesit in adverso gravis hasta minoris Atride.
Cognovi clypeum, laeva gestamina nostra
Nuper Abanteis, templo J unonis, in Argis.''

It is tmly wonderful to find in these Latin authors the
doctrines of the immortality of the soul, and of futurerewards
and punishments, so mixed up with the wildest fables and the
errors and superstitious ol Heathen Polytheism.

In support ol my belief that this Ode was originally
written in Greek, I subjoin a sort ol proofdy inooesron,
showing how naturally the first six lines fall into correspond-
ing Greek metra-an example which Ι owe to the scholarship
ol my friend the Rev. W. G. Oookesley‚ late of Eton college,
who at my suggestion has favoured me with these lines, for
which contribution I give him my humble but heerty thanks.

When we consider that Archytas was a Tarentino by
birth, and was chosen no less than seven times to be Ghiel'
Magistrate of this Greek Republic‚ nothing⁴ oan be more
probable than that the melancholy death by shipwreck of
so distinguished a character should have boen celebrated by
a Tarentina poet in Greek verse, ol which Horace's translation
now only survives.
