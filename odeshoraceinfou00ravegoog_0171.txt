The shadows now of mighty leaders nise,

Soiled with no shameful dust before our eyes; ,
We see the world and every foe subdued,

All save indomitable Cato's mood.

J uno, and whatsoever Gods that late

Had grieved in vain for conquered Afric’s fate,
Behold with joy the sacrifices made

Of Roman victims to J ugurtha's shade.

How many a gaping grave, how many a plain
Made fat with corpses of the Latian slain,

Bear witness to these fatal wars‚ and speed
News of Hesperia's ruin to the Mede.

What river can be named whose peaceful banks
Have never known the shock of hostile ranks?

What scas are not incarnadined? what shore

Isss‘yet unstained by floods of Roman gere?

But hush, presumptuous Muse! nor here prolong
The mournful burthen of the Cean song3
Come, modulate with me a lighter stava
Reclined within some Dionaean* eave.

⁸ Dionaean, dedicated to Dione or Venus.
