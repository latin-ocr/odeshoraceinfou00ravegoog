OBSERVATION S ou Onu III.

This Ode requires more explanation thau usual to make
the scheme and scope oi it intelligihle. It commences by
drawing the character oi a just, resolute, and courageous man.
Various examples are then cited oi mortals who, hy the
exercise oi these virtues, had been thought worthy of being
enrolled among the immortal Gods. In this list Augustus is
adroitly included by that speeies of adulation which iu those
days was endured. Then, after referring to the Apotheosis
of Romulus, thc son of Mars, the Poet, with astonishiug
abruptncss, makes duno ‘⁴ riae ia her phaofi and address a long
oration to the conclave oi heaven, which “ Quaen’s speech to
the Upper House'' occupies all the remainder oi this remark-
able Ode.

It is supposed that just at that time Augustus, perhaps
wearied and exasperated by the sections which rent society at
Rome, or perhaps from other motives, seriously entertained
the project oi transferring the scat of empire to the site oi
ancient Troy, therehy anticipating hy some centuries the sub-
sequent foundation of an Eastern Empire of Rome.

'lhe sole object of the haraugue ingeniously put into Juno’s
mouth is to deter the Emperor from the further prosecution
oi ao dangerons and uupopular a design. The Quaen of
Heaven declares that all the ancient wrongs oi the racc os
Laomedon are forgiven, and that she is willing to welcome
the son os Mars aud Ilia, and his posterity, into the circle of
the Immortals. She predicte the glories oi unbounded empire
to Rome, hut eo long only as no restoration be attempted of
the nrined walls of Ilium :- ’

“Dum longua inter saeviat Ilion
Romamque pontus.·'

Such appears to be the only rational explanation of this
