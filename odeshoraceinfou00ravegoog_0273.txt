THE ODES OF Holmon. 1300ss 111.

“ So longas Ooenn's noves divide
“ The walls of Rome from Ilion’s side,
“ Lot her exiled children reign
“ From Indus to the Westem main 1
“ As long as Phryginn flocks find room
“ For pasture upon Prinm's tomb,
“ And Paris’ monument gives place

. “Osrefugetothebeastsofohnse3
“ So long let Roman armies speed
“ Their triumphs o'er the conquemd Mede,
“ And hostile nations held in thmll
‘⁸ Swear fenlty to the Capitol.
“ Lot Rome her dreaded name extend
“ To every mgion's utmost end ;

“ From the far West, whom narrow sens
“ Divide the rocks of Herculeo,
“ To Egypt’s realm and Delta’s Iole,
“ Watered by the teeming Nile.

' “ Let her with brare contempt roeign
“ Tho golden treasuoes of the mine;

. “ thabata lest, than to provide

“ The pomps of Luxnry and Pn‘de.
‘⁴ Her steps and trophies shall be found
“ To the wide Enrth’s remotrst bound ;

¹ ‘⁸ Where the red Snn’s meridinn ray

' “ Darts down intolornble day,

' ⁸⁸ And where tho Scythinn tempests blow

‘· From hina of ererlnsting snow.
