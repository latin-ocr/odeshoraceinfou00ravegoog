ODE XIII.

ΤΟ THE Tmen wmcn IN ITS ΕΔΗ, IIAD NEARLY
CRUSHED HIM.

Iu evil3emeeed day with impious hand

(Whos‘ee'e'r it was), thou most unlucky tree!

He from thy native soil transplanted thee,
Thou bane and curse of all th' adjacent land,
And working mischief to Posterity!
Yea, I believe that such a wretch some time
Had wrung his parent's neck, or steeped in crime
Had stained his nightly chamber with the blood
Of stranger guest, or sacrilegious stood
Within the charmed ring by sorcery traced,
Mingling the Colchian drug, or whatsoe'er
Most venomous is held in earth or air,
Who first within these precincts placed
Thee, thou unholy plant, foredoomed to shed
Destruction on thy master's guiltless head!
