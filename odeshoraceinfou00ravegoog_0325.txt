“ Ae when the tigrees team her prey,

“ Their nuptiul oouch in carnage swims3
“ But I arn gentler far than they,

“ Nor will I pierce or bind thy limbo.

“ Let my stern sire with ravage chain

“ Weigh down, for this, my tender hunde,
“ Or drive me 0’er the benting main

“ But thou begone 1 nor wait the morrow,
“ Venus shall guide thee through the gloom3

“ And mindful still, engrave in sorrow
“ A kindly record on my tomb.”

OBSERVATIONS.

The concluding stannes of this musical end ingenious Ode
oontain n most touching picture of the nuptial fidelity oi
Hypermneetre, daughter of Danaus. “ One alone among
many who, worthy of the nupticl torch,” saved the lise oi her
youthful husband Lynceus, und reveoled to him the odious
plotio which his brethren were sacntieed on that momoroble
night. Ovid heo written e charming Epistle on the seme
subject, but in these few stannes Horace has given the esseuoe
oi Ovid's dilution. These appear to me the most handful
Sapphico which exist in the Latin tongue.

One single line in this Odeis so ungreoeful‚ thet I cen
source think it wco thus written by Horeee :-

⁴⁶ Centum
Munient angues ceput ejus, atque
Spiritus teter‚'' hc.

The expression hes been universally censurcd‚ ond novor
suecessiully defended.

1838.
