still had she raved, but Venus earne
And stood beside the weeping dame,
Perfidious smiling as she leant
On Cupid with his bow unbent.
Awhile she teased her, but anon
Addressing her in graver tone,
“ Be still !'' she ories, ‘⁴ henceforth assuage
“ All idle grief, and calm thy rage,
“ When thy fierce anger to sustain
“ The hated bull shall come again
“ Know that unconquerable Jove
‘⁶ Hath sought and won thy virgin love ς
“ His bride thou art, and half the world shall claim

“ In honour of thy lot Europa’s name.''

OBSERVATIONS.

In this Ode Horace addresses some noble young lady under
the name of Galatea, who is about to sturton a distant
expedition. He tells her not to be afraid os omens, by which
the wicked only are deterred from their purpose. He con-
eludes with the story of Europa, though with what object it
is difficult to determine. It seems uncertain whether by that
example he wishes to deter Galatea from her voyage, or
whether he thinks only to amuse her by the narrative. Be
this as it rnay, the episode of Europa's ssight is most beauti-
fully told, her distrass oi mind most naturally depicted, and
tho whole most ingeniously concluded by the unexpected ap-
pearance os the Quaen of love, and the short address with
which she consoles the afflicted wanderar.
