ODE XXIV.

ΤΟ VIRGIL.

Wnnn shame or limit shall there be

To grief for one so loved as he,
Whose fn'endship still we orave!

Do thou, Melpomene, inspire

Such mournful strains as erst thy sire

To thy sweet harpings gave.

Hath then the hand of Death opprest
Quinctilius, laid in endless rest?

To whose unblemished mind
Ingenuous Shame, and Truth sineere,
And Faith ahin to J ustiee, ne’er ,

Α parallel shall find. ’

Full many a fiiend bewails him dead,

But bitterer tears by none are shed‚
O Virgil! than by thee:

Pious in vain, thou eouldst not save

Quinctilius from an early grave,
Nor soften Fate’s decree.
