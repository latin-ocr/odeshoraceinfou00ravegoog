ODE VI.

TO APOLLO.

Gon of the silver bow, from thee

The rece of hapless Niobe

Received just punishment, to teach
The sin of proud and impious speech3

Thine arrows quelled huge Tityos’ lust,
And stem Achilles laid in dust

. Beneath the battlemented town

Of yet uneonquered Ilion.

Fair Thetis’ son a soldier he,
Unmatehed by all till matched by thee,
Although the Darden towers he shook
With his broad spear's tremendous stroke.
He like a pine by axes felled,

Or cypress tall by storms impelled‚
Bowed down and laid his lofty' head
In Trojan dust among the dead.

He was not one to share the cheat

Of that famed horse, or eounherfeit

Minerva's idol to invade

Old Priam's court in slumber laid;
