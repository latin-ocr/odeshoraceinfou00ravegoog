ODE XXI.

ΤΟ ms CASK.

Ο οΑεΚ of happiest augury

Born in the sels-same year with me
Of Manlius’ Consulship 1

Whether disputes or wit you move,

Or brawls foment or frantie love,
Or light and easy sleep :-

Wonhy of all regard the while,
Under whatever name or style
You keep your preeious stone ;

At good Corvinus’s command
Come down and in libatione bland
Your mellow contente pour.

Though with Socratie lore imbued‚
No churlish comrade he nor rude,
But loves your jniee benign ;

For even Cato’s rugged frown
And Stoie virtue sostened down
Of old, when warmed with wine.
