Happy the man whose frugal board
Displays his grandsire’s silver hoard3
Whose peaeeful dreams and eouch of rest,
N or avariae nor sear molest.

Why do presumptuous mortale rear
Vast schemes in their brief sojourn here?

Why roam beneath a foreign sky?
What exile from himself ean fly?

Care follows the fleet galley’s course,
Nor leaves the ghttering troops of horse,
vaifter than stags or tempests driven
By Eurus o'er the rolling heaven.

No fears of hiture pain annoy

The man intent on present joy3

Who smiles by petty griefs distrest, ’
For nought is altogether blest.

Death early closed Achilles' day,
Tithonus pined in long deeay3
Perchance the passing hour to me
May proffer joys denied to thee.

An hundred fleeey flocks are thine,
And pastures of Sicilian kine;

By pampered steeds thy car is roll'd,
And purple robes thy limbs enfold.
