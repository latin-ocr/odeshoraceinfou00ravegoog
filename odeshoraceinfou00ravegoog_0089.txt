“ Olleus' armus, winged with sate,
“ May seek thee now iu vain,
“ And vengeance for awhile may wait,
‘⁶ Yet dust and gore shall, soon or late,
“ Thy looks adulterous stain.
“ See, Laertiades comes on,
“ Thy nation’s bane! See Merion,
“ And Nestor shake his spearl
“ See fearless Teucer join the course,
“ And Sthenelus urge his foamiug horse,
“ No sluggish charioteer!
“ And Diomed, with dart of fire,
“ Mightier than his mighty sirei
“ Whom, panting, like the stag that spies
“ lu dusk the tiger’s flaming eyeS,
“ Thou fliest, regardless os thy boast,
“ Fidelity and honour lost.
“ Achilles' wrath shall yet delay
“ To Trojan dames the fatal day 3
“ Those hours elapsed, her fanos and spires
“ Shall sink enveloped in Achaian fires.'’

OBSERVATIONS.

This prophecy of Nereus, touchiug the destruction of
Troy, is said to have hoen addressed to Marh Antony and
Cleopatra, as a naming against the niekedness os plunging
the Roman empire into a civil war. The plain meaning,
however, is sufficient for our admiration of this ingenious
and most spirited Ode.

Dee. 1851.
