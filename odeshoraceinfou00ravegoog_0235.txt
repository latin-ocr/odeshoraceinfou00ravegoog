To me not less indulgent Fato

Hath given my father's small estate,
Some spirit of the Greeian song,
And scorn for the malignsnt throng.

OBSERVATIONS.

This must always be a favour-ite Ode with the admirere of
Horeoe. The versification is so musical and the sentiments
so natural, that the mind of the render is carried on in sym-
pathy with the poet from the beginning to the end, regretting
only that tho strain should come ιο so speedy a conclusion.
Ihsve sometimes imeginod that the two opening stannus
referred to the general paeifiostion of the world after Augustus
was established on the Imperial throne, when tho Temple of
denus was closed, no. 36.

In this version I have in no single instance transgressed
the limite os my original, stanno sor stanna being strictly
rendered. I should feel better satisfied with the general
result of my labours‚hed1beenenabled ιο unere ιο the
samo rulo in many mora instances.

May, 1834.
