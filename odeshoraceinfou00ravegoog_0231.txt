ODE XVI.

TO GROSPHUS.

Tosn on the wide AEgeen seen,

The sailor prays ho Heeven for ease;
When the moon hides her waning light,
And stare ere lost in thickest night.

The quivered Medes and warlike Thrace,
Fetigued with tumult, sigh for peace ;
That peace, oh, Grosphus! still unsold

For purple minent, geme, or gold.

Since neither weelth nor regal state
The ilis of care can mitigate,

Nor bribe to ease those mental stings
Thnt haunt the palaces of kings.
