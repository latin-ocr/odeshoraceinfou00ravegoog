258 nnn onns on nonncn. noon m.

Marvel it was to all who dwelt
On Acherontia's mountain-chain,
Or in the Bantine forest belt,
Or low Forentum's fertile plain,
That thus I slept secure from barm
On heaps of bay and myrtle pileo, ·
Proteoted by a mightier arm,
Dear to the Gods, a sprightly child!
Your slave and worshipper‚ harmonious Nine‚
Still call me, whether on the Sabine hills
Or by Praeneste's shade, or Tibur’s rins,
Or where proud Baiae mles the liquid brine.
Preserved by you, Ι ’scoped Philippi's host,
And the late peril of a falling tree 3

Esoaped the shipwreoh on Sicilia’s coast
Where Palinurus beetles o’er the sea.

With you I’ll dare to navigate
The raging Hellespontio strait‚
And travel to those distant lando
Beyond Assyria's burning sands3
Unharmed I'll see the Britons rude,
I'll see the Gelons' quivered ranke,
The Concan reared on horse's blood,
The Scythian Tanais’ frozon banks.
Ye, in some oool Pierian cave,
Refresh great Caesar’s mind, fatigued with war,
When home returning with his cohorte bravo,
He bids them sheathe the bloodless soymitar.
