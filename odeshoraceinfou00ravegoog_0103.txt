ODE XX.

ΤΟ MAEcENAs.

In uninvited thus you come,

MaeeenaS, to your Poet’s home,

Expeet, dear Knight, no better fare

Than Sabine wine in goblets sparo,
Whose vintage dates from that same year,
When, in the Roman theatre,

The plaudite ofa grateful crowd

To greet your entrance, sounded loud
O'er Tiber's baalia, and eohoing ran
Prolonged across the Vatican.

Yet, come! and with you bring the flask,
Fresh mantling from Calenian eask3

For neither do F alernian vinos
Contributa to my stoek of winea,

Nor F ormian hills for poets' use

Cons'ent to yiold their generous juiee.

OBSERVATION S.

Aa the poet, expecting a visit from Maecenate, tells him
that he ean give nothing better than cheap Sabine wine

“ b l’ordinaire,'’ it is clear, that if he is to drink the Caecubon,
or Calenian, he (Maecenas) must bring it himself.

Jan. 1840.
