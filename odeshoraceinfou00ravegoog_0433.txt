So saw the Vindelician herde
Young Drusus lead the war
Beyond the Rhaetian Alps asar,
And flesh his maiden sword 3
Wild tribes that still in battle-field
The Amazonian wer-axe wield,
(From whence derived, I've sought in vain,
Nor boote it now such use t’ explain,
All knowledge man cannot attain);
But these late conquering armies, now '
By youthsul oounsels overthrown,
Quail in their turn before the blow
Of Drusus’ valiant arm, and own

What glorious feats, what godlike fire

A fitting culture may inspire,
What Caesar’s training can unfold
In youths of N ero’s generous mould.
From sire to son the breve we trade,
E'en steens and steeds their lineage prove,
Nor do the savage faloon's rece
Beget the weak and gentle dove.
But learning gives the better part
To innate worth, and trains the heart ε
Where virtue ’s wanting, crimes disgraee
The purest blood, the noblest raee.
Oh, Rome l how vasta debt ie thino
Yet due to N ero’s royal line,
