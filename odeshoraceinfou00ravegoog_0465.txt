442 run onas or noanon. Boon ·

Of all her sex the Spartan dame
Was not the only one who nurst
In secret au unholy flame
For some gay suitor, nor the first
His train of princes to admire,
· His persumed looks and rich attire.

Full many an archer shot his shaft
Before fam’d Teucer hent a how3
Nor once alone besieger's craft
Had threatened Ilion's tovers with woe ;
Nor great Idomeneus alone,
Or Sthenelus and Merion

Fought battles fit for Poet’s page ;
Nor valiant Hector, and the bravo

Deiphobus, were first to wage

A deadly light, resolved to save
Their virtuous wives, and offspring dear
From a proud foeman's ruthless spear.

Full many a chief and warrior lived
Ere Agamemnon saw the day,
Of whom no record hath survived
The glories that have past away ;
Unwept, unsnng, unknown, they lie
F or want of hallowed Poesy.
