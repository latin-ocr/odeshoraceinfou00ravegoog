ODE XII.

TO nnossunn.

Fonnonu are the demsels who never ean prove
The joys of the wine-cup or pleasures of love 3
Condemned to endure, for their sins, ull day long
The reviling and soourge of a step-father’s rongue.
No such cause heve you, Neobule‚ to fret,
For the wing'd son of Venus een melre you forget
All the worhs of Minerva, your basket end thread,
η While Hebrus of Lipara runs in your head.
As glowing he bethes in the Tiber’s eool tides,
Or fairer than febled Bellerophon rides,
Unmstohed in the ring for his prowess end grece,
With the oaestus uneonquered and first in the rece.
Nor unskilled in the forest to drive the wild deer
In herds o’er the plain, and transfix with his speer
The feirest end fattest, or venture to eloy

The wild-boar as he stands in the thielret et bey.
