ODE VI.

ΤΟ THE ROMANS.

On, Romans! ye shall pay with tears
Delinquencies of former years,
Though not yourselves to blame 3
Until the temples ye repair‚
And renovate the altars bare
All blaek with smoke and flame.

In every act, in every thought,

Let reverence to the Gods be taught ;
Be this your object still.

By this neglect offended Heaven

To bleeding Italy hath given
Full many a grievous ill.

By Pacorus and Monaeses led,

Tvviee hath the Parthian bravely sped,
And turned our arms to flight3

Proud to adorn his gorget chain

With jevels plundered from the slain
In those sad fields of fight.
