OBSERVATIONS ro Oon IV.

This Ode has given birth to a variety of speculatione from
that class of commentators who are always hunting for a
second meaning in every passage that can be twisted intoa
double sense. It begins by an invocation to Calliope to ossist
tho Poet in the composition of a long meloc,· and, in fact, it is
the longest of his lyrical productione, consisting of twenty
Aloaic stanzas. He becomes speedily involved in a poetical

raptura, and narrates the highly romantio and beautiful iu-

with Pindario abruptness, to the war of the 'litans and the
gallant resistance of the Immortal Gods, in which he devotos

Apollo. It is in reference to this portion of the Ode that one
of the commentatore informs us, “that it is plainly manifest
that Jove means Augustus, and that the 'litans mean the late
adversaries of tho successful Emperor.'‘ Nay, more; not only
is the parallel instituted between Augustus and dove, but it
must undoubtedly be continued to Pallas, thus symbolising
“the combination of wisdom and valour.” Possibly some
parallel may have been intended by the Poet in honour of

⁴ the successful Emperor, especially where he contrasts the .
failure of brute force against tempered valour. Even if this
