ODE XXXI.

ΤΟ APOLLO.

WnAr deth the modest Bard require
From him, the Master of the Lyre ;
Before whose consecrated shrine

He pours a flood of genereus wine?
He asks not for the teeming grain
Gathered in rich Sardinia's plain 3
Nor for the wealth of countless flocks
That wander o'er Calabria's rocks
And sunny vales ; he doth not sigh
For Indian gold 0r ivory‚

' Nor for those fertile pastures crare,
Which Liris cleaves with silent ware.

Let those 011 whom fair F ortune shines
Prune for the press their clustering vines ;
Lct the rich merchant chcer his seul,
And drain at will the golden borel,
Whilst he the costly draught repairs
With bartcr of Sidonian wares.
