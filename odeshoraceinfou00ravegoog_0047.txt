Death with the same impaitial tread

Knocks at the beggar’s lowly shed,
And shakes the pulace gete 3

Ah, favoured Sextius! lile’s brief sum

Forbids long hope of days to come,
And warns us 01 our fate.

The Ghosts in story farned and Night

811011 00011 oppress thy falling sight,
And beckon to that mad,

Whither when once thy steps descend,

All earthly joys and hopes shall end
In Pluto's drear abode.

OBSERVATIONS.

This Ode is another example 01 the poct's favourite style 01
moralising. It contains a singular expression 111 1110 scventh
and eighth lines :—

“ dum graves Cyclopum
Vulcanus ardens urit officinas.”

What does this mean?

Is it that Vulcan, ardent 111 his love 101· 1110 sponse, bums
his workshop that hc may pursue her into the company 01 the
Nymphs and Graues? 01 10 11 0 pleasant irony and a play
upon the 110111 “ardens'’ meaning that, 1111110 Cytherea is
thus enjoying herself, this ardent husband is blowing up tho
fires 01 the workshop 01 the Cyclops?

lconfess mysclf unable to resolve this question. The

' commentators 111 general seem to favour the latter solution.
I have sometimes conjectured 0 possible erratum 1011101188,
and imagined that Horace might have written not ⁴‘ urit,”
