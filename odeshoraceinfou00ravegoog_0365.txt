ODIl XXII.

TO DIANA.

ennon Goddess, guardian of the woodo,
And Lycia’s mountain solitudes

In threefold power adored ;
When thn’ee invoked thou hear'st the cry
Of wives in childbirth’s agony

By thee to life restored:

still let thy favoured pino aloof

Wave high above my villa’s roos,
whose stem the blood shall stain

Ofa young boar with tusky oheek

Thnt meditates the blow oblique,
A vietim yearly elain.

OBSERVATIONS.

'lllese two stenzes were perhaps written merely sor on in-
scription on the pino-tree secred to Diona that weved high
’ above the ville os the Poet.

Oce. ³0, 1851.
