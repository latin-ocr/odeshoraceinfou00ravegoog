202 000 onus 00 000100. BOOK 11.

In vain from bloody Mars we run,
In vain the broken billows shun

Of Hadria’s roaring seas3
And vainly timorous seek to shroud
Our bodies from th' autumnal cloud

And pestilential breeze.

Cocytus, in his mazy bed,

Must soon or late be visited,
And Lethe's languid waters3

And Sisyphus despairing still

To mount th' insuperable hill,
And Danaus' guilty daughters.

Thy lande, and home, and pleasing wife, ·
Must all be lest with parting life3
And save the bough abhorred
Of monumenta] cypress, none
Of all the trees thy care hath grown
Follow their short-lived lord.

A worthier heir shall grasp thy keyS‚
And all thy hoarded vintage seize
From bolts and bars released3
And stain thy floor with nobler wine
Than ever flowed at holy shrine,
Or pontificial feast.

Jan. 1833.
