Then, Bacchus, be thy glories told,
Triumphant from barbarie war3

And thine, ehaste Huntress of the woll,
And Phoebus' shafts and beaming ear.

Alcides next, and Leda’s twins,
Unmatched for each Olympian prize,
Whose silver star no sooner shines
On tossing sess and stom-swept skies,

Thau straight the foamy rocks are dry,
The winds are lulled, clouds fiee away ;

And Oeean’s surge, late heaving high,
Lies calm beneath the sacred ray.

And now shall Romulus the strain
Exalt, or Tarquin’s regal pride ;

Or heaven-taught Numa's peaceful reign,
Or Cato’s noble suicide?

Or shall the gratefirl poet tell
How Paulus, prodigal of life,
Before his Punic conqueror fell,
Not unavenged in Cannae’s strife3

Or of the Scauri's honoured rare,
Ἴ Or Regulus, the sels-consigned
To torture rather than disgraee‚
Or good Fabricius' simple mind?
