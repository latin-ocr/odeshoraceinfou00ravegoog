ODE XII.

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS.

Wnnr chief or hero wilt thou take,
What God, O Muse! shall be thy choice?
Whose name may swell the chordo, and wake
The mountain echo's sportive voice?

Either on wooded Helicon,
Pindus or Haemus' snowy chain,
Whose trees in stately dance moved on,
To Thracian Orpheus’ vocal strain3

He, by his mother's art, delayed
The winde and wetere rushing hy3
While listening oaks advanced their chade,

Led by the wondrous melody.

First the great Parent let us praise,
Whom Gods and men alihe revere,

Who with impartial justice sways
The world and all this nether sphere3

Which nought produceth to be named
Of paramount or equal power,

Yet next to him is Pallas iamed
For Virtue’s and for Wisdom'e dower.
