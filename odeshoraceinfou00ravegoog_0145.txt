ODE XXXIII.

TO ALBIUS TIBULLUS.

Ou, cesse, Tibullus! oease to mourn

ἱ For her who pays thy love with scorn,

Nor wail in elegiae strain
That younger hearts such prize should gain3
For Cyrus fair Lycoris burns,

While Pholoe from Cyrus turns3

For sooner shall the tender lambo
Desert for wolves their blesting dams,
Thau Pholoe shall endure the vows
Which his adulterous heart bestows.
But such is Venus whose delight

Itis strange tempero to unite,

And different forms and minds to sway
Beneath her yohe in oruel play.

Me, whom a worthier damsel sought,
Young Myrtale to bondage brought,

A nymph, caprieious as the breeze
That skims the Hadriatie sess,

And wilder than the billows tost

On steep Calabria’s winding coast.

Jun. 1841.
