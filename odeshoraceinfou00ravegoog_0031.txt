ΤΗΕ ODES 01‘ HORACE BOOK 1.

Where ost the N ymphs and Fauns attend,
If but her pipe Euterpe lend,
Nor Polyhymnia deny
Her harp of Lesbian melody.
So to the stars l shall sepire,
By thee enrolled among the lyrie quire.

OBSERVATION S.

This first Ode is upon Horaoe's favourite subjeel‚-viz.
the diversity os testes and employments in human lise. The
same tone of feeling may be trseed in the first Ode os the
third Book, and in the first Satine, as well as in numerous
other passages of his writings. In sset, he is never weary
of moralising upon the chauces and changes of this mortal
life, and bringing to his aid the doctrines os Epicurus, to
make the best os such vicissitudes by enjoying the present

’ hour while he ean.
