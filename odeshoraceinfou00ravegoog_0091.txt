ODE XVI.

(imment.)

Fene daughter of a noble line,
Destroy, destroy the fatal page,
Envenomed by a lover's roge ;
Commit it ιο the flames, and cast
Its ashes to the driving blast!

Not Dindymene, nor the shrine

Of Pythos ficrcer shakes its priest-
Not Bacchus ot the drunkcn feast,
Where Corybantian hands excite
The guests to riot and to right,
More vvildly agitatos the henrt

Thon rege, which neither swerd can tame,
N or billowy sea, nor cruel flame,

Nor the tremendous voice of Jove

In avvful tumult from above.

PrometheuS‚ when he chose each pert,
Ere from his hand the moulded earth
Rose animate to perfect birth,

Engaged the lion in his path,
And took forman the lion's wrath.
