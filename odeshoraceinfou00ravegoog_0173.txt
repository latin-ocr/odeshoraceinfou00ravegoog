ODE II.

TO CRISPUS SALLUSTIUS.

Tin ore hath neither grace nor worth
When hid within the greedy earth,

Oh, Crispus! hating wealth alone,
Save when in temperate usa 'tis shown.

Let Proculeius’ generous name
Survive to everlasting fame,

Who paid with more than father's care
Twice told his needy brethren’s share.

To curb an avan’cious soul,

Demands a more severe control

Than all tha lands of Southern Spain,
With Carthage and the Libyan plain.

Dropsy, by sels-indulgence nurst,
Can ne'er allay its victim’s thirst,
Until the sever's cause be known,
And languor from the system flown.
