ODE XVII.

ΤΟ TYNDARIS.

ΟΠ doth the nimble Pan exchange
His loved Areadin’s mountain range
For my fair villa’s calm retreat,
Where, from the sultry summer’s heat,
Or from the tempest's ruder shoek,
He daily guards my bearded doch.
There do my gnate securely rove
Through arbutus and chestnut·grove;
My kids range 0’er the thymeclad seeum,
Nor dread the ravenous wolf of Mars,
N or tremble if, perehanee‚ are seen
Gliding along the serpente green,
When in his pipe's melodious voice
Ustiea's nave-worn rocks rejoice.

The Gods protect me, and inspire

The strain that thrills upon my lyre3

Then, if thou’lt grace my home awhile,
Dear Tyndaris, with thy winning smile,
shall Plenty‚ rich in rural store,

Her choicest fruits around thee pour ;
