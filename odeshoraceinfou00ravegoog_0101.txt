ODE XIX.

ΤΟ GLYOERA.

Tua cruel Mother os the LoveS,
And Semele's entrancing boy,

And all-absorbing Passion moves
My mind to seek forgotten joy.

Me Glycera’s fair image wama,

More bright than polished Parian st0n03
Me the maid’s yielding coyness charms,
And smiles too arch to look upon.

Venus forsaking Cyprus’ coast
On me exerts her fiareest might,

Nor lets me sing of Scythia's host,
Or Parthian squadron's vengeful ssight.

Then let the turfen altar shine
With all the incense of the grove,
And seed the flama with generous wine,
Thus shall the Goddess milder prove.

Dec. 1840.
