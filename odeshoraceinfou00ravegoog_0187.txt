Thee will she soon pursue, for Time
Rolls on relentlessly,

And adds ιο her advanoing prime
The years he takes from thee ;

Then wauton Lalage with butting brows,
Shall wake the slumbering passion of her spouse.

She! more admired by all beholders
Than bashful Pholoe,
Or Chloris of the snowy shoulders,

Who shines, as on the sea
Rises in radianee mild the Quaen of Night,
When rippling waves refleet her silver light.

she! fairer than that Gnidian youth,
Who, ’mid the virgin quire
Disguised, might so conceal the truth
In his assumed altine,
That none deteet the beauteous stranger there
In that ambiguous face and flowing hair.

OBSERVATION S.

We know not ιο whom this beautiful allegory is eddressed.
The lesson is applicable to alleges, solongas human infirmity
shall be found ιο prevail over duty and decorum, and it can
never be given in a more pleasing and less offensive form.
There is, perhaps, a slight fault notieeable in recurring ιο the
original metaphor in the fourth stanna, after having flown ιο
another totally different in the third; but the danger of “ me-
taphorieal confusion” is most ingeniously evadal.
