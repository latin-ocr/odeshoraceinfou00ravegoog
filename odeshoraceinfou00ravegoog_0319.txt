If neither gista nor tendor vous,

' Nor these wan cheeks can pity move;
Nor the desertion of your spouse,

Smit with a badad-singer’s love3

Not sotter is your bosom’s mould

Than rugged oaks which none may break ;
Not milder your affcctions cold

Than Mauritania's venomed snake.

Not always will this breast be found
Patient alike of sun and shower,
Laid at your thrcshold on the ground.

Fourth Book we find the rejected admirer venting forth the
most spiteful and insulting reproaches to her, whomin this
Ode he supplicator sor her favours in rain.

Truly hc says that he will not always be found patient os
injurias, aud he bears a long and steadlast recollection of
Lyce's pride and obduracy.

Mavult, 1851.
