ODE X.

To MERCURY.

i OMERceRY, great Atlas' son,

Ι Skilled with persuasive voice to tame
ἱ Fierce men from savage nature won,
¹ To leam th' arena's gmeeful gamo!

¹ I sing thee, messenger of Jove,
Inventor of the tuneful lyre,

' Cunning to hide whate'er thy love
(,>ftl1eft and frolic may acquire.

ἷ At thy deoeit Apollo smiled
When thou, pretending to resign

’ His stolen beffos, a roguish child,
Purloinod his quiver with his kine.

Rich Priam, by thy guidanoe‚ went
From Ilion's gato, past watch and ward,
= To stern Achilles' hostile tent,
fl Through Grecian fires and slumbe1·ing guard. j
