60 vna onas ov noaaca. aoox 1.

ln this thy day of grief,
Where are the Gods whom thou
May'st call to thy relies
With unavailing vovv?
And where thina ancient fame,-
And where the terrore of thy name?
Daughter of the Pontio pine‚
An empty boast, alas 1 isthine3
The timid mariner no more
Will trust a gilded shell, but rotten core:
Bevvarel lest on the mod-beaoh stranded high,
The windo and waves shall moek thy fallen
majeaty.

Oh, thou, for whom I gave

The day of toil, the anxious night,
It rests with me to orave
That Jove, omnipotent to save,
May still protect the right!
Avoid, avoid the restless seas,
That rage and eddy round the shining Cyclades.

OBSERVATIONS.

In spite of Quinctilian'o authority, certain orities insist
that this oelebrated allegory is no allegory at all, but a mere
matter-of-soet address to a real ship about to leave port on a
real voyage. I may say, in the words of Cicero, “Malim
equidem oum Quinctiliano errare, quam eum istis vera sentire.“

Nov. 1838.
