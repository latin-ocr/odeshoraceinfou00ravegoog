Happy the man, and happy he alone,

He, who ean eall to-day his own:

He who, secure within, ean say,

To·morr0w do thy worst, for Ι have lived to-day.

Be fair, or foul, or rain, 01· shine,
The joys Ι have possessed, in spite of fate are mine,
Not Heav’n itself upon the past has pow'r,
But what has been, has been, and Ι have had my hour.

Fortune, that with malicious joy
Does man her slave oppress,
Proud of her office to destroy,
’ Is seldom pleased to bless:

still various and uneonstant still,

But with an inclination to be ill,
Promotes‚ degradeS, delights in strife,
And makes a lottery of life.

I can enjoy her while she‘s kind ;

But when she danees in the wind,

And shakes her wings and will not stay,

Ι puff the prostitute away ε ,

The little or the much she gave, is quietly resigned ; ἶ
Content with poverty, my soul Ι arn13
And virtue, though in rags, will keep me warm.

l What is't to me

l Who never sail in her unfaithful sea,
l If storms arise, and elouds grew black3
Ι If the mast split, and threaten wreek3
