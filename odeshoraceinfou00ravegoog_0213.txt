ODE XII.

TO MAECEMS.

Tuon wilt not that Numantia's wars 1 sing,
Nor the stem Hannibal, nor ocean's tide
th Carthaginien slnughter dyed, ·
Upon my feeble lyre’s unwarlike string3
Nor the fieree Lapithae, and the nuptinls mnrred
By lewd Hylaeus, nor the trnin
Of enrthborn ginnts by Alcides slain,
- Who shook the powers of Hennen, and warred
Agninst nlmighty Jove and ancient satum’s reign.
Thyself, Maecenns, in befitting prose
Shalt tell of ems triumphs 0'er the foes
He fought and conquered, and the fnll
Of bonstful monarchs led in captive thmll.
Far other themes my Mnse inspire—

ί Lycimnia's voice, Lyeimnia's lyre3
ι

1 Her eyes that beam Love's sostest fire,
Ι Her breast thnt glows with wan-m desire3 ἱ
