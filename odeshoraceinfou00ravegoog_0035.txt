10 11111 onus on uouucu. 1100111.

Avenging thus sad llia’s woes
Poured 101111 for murdered Caesar's blood,

While, not with J ove's consent, he flows
O'er his lest bank in raging flood.*

Diminishod by their parents' ouime
Our youth shall hear that civil strife
Forgetting hostile Persia's elimo,
At Roman bosoms oimod the knife.

What God in our distrest affairs
Shall we invoke to aid the State?
How shall the sacred Virgin's prayers
Appeaso obdurate Vesta's hate?

Who at the high behest of J ove

shall expiate the deod of blood?
Desceud, Apollo, from above,

Thy radiance veiled in silvei· cloud!

Or let the laughtor-loving Deme

Whom ssuttering Love and Mirth embrace- ,
Or, satiate with his cruel gome,

Lot Mars uphold his sainting raee :-

“ The version of this stanna, even in its present imperfect
form, was amatter os incredible difficulty. Ι1 is so obscure
in the original, that without the lobour os commentators 11
would be absolutely unintelligible.
