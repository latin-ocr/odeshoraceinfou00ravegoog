Ye give good counsel, and are glad
When rfghteous deeds confound the bad ε
Aa when the Titan's giant brood,

From heaven to hell in flight pursued,
Fell thunderotriohen from above,

Blaated by the fires of Jove ;—

Of Jove, who rnles with equal hand

The heaving sea and solid land,

And Gods above and men below,

And Pluto'e shadowy realm of woe.

No small amount of wrath and sear

T’ its oentre shook tho stany sphere,
When those fierce brethren, leaguing still

Their giant arms for blows and blood,

Heaped on Olympus Pelion's hill

Uptorn with all his waving wood3
But not Typhoeus, nor the might
Of Mimaa nor Porphyrion's height ;
Not Rhoetus of portentous sizo,

Nor heaving foresta to the skiee
Could bold Enceladus prevail

'Gainst Pallas' shield and eoat of mail.
Lo Ι here the queenly J uno stood3
There Vulcan, in his fiery mood,
And there the God of Light, who ne'or
Divests his shoulder of tho bow;
Who bathea his goldon orispbd hair
In dews from Castaly that flow,
