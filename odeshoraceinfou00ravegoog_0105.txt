ODE XXI.

TO DIANA ΛΝΒ APOLLO.

ΥΕ Virgine, sing Diana’s name!

Ye Boys, Apollo's glory sing!
And celebrate Latona’s fame,
Beloved by Heaven’s Almighty King.

Dian, who loves the limpid floods,
Which Algidus' deep bosom shields,

The gloom of Erymanthian woodS,
The verdure of the Lycian fields,

Ye Boys! let Tempe's flowery vale,

Let Delos' Isle your song inspire!
Hail the far-shooting Archer! hail

The God that strikes the golden lyre!

He, gracious to his suppliant's prayer,
shall drive from conquering Caesar's host
The curse effamine, plague‚ and war,
To Persia’s realm and Britain's coast.

Jan. 1840.
