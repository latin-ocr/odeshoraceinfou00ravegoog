ODE XXV.

TO LYDIA.

Burrum, Lydia, raroly now
Do the wauton striplings knook

At your lattioed window's bow, ·
Turn tho hingo, or try the look.

To ito threshold oleoves your gato,
Soldom now you hear tho plaint,

“ Lydia, pity us who wait
“ In the night air, shivering, faint1”

Down some ontry bide the scorn
Of each hoedless passer-by,

Weoping as tho north winds mourn
Through the blouk and moonloss sky.

When unbridled passion's fire,
Rushing like a summer flood,
With the sense of keen desire
Goads your beart and heato your blood,
