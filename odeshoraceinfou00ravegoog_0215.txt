192 nnn onas or noanon. Boon 11.

Whose step is foremost in the hall
On chaste Diana’s festiva13
Whosc snowy arms high test in air
Outehine the brightest virgins there.
Possessed of treasures such aa these,
Would’st envy rich Achaemenes?
Or change Lycimnia’s locks of gold
For all the Arabian coffers hold?
When she invites the burning kias,
Or from her fond admirer flies‚
That he may snatch by force the bliss
Which she with easy cruelty denies.

OBSERVATION S.

Thia Ode, addressed to Maecenas, ia much of the same
⁸ character aa the preceding one. He flies off from politice and

history to the praiaes of the beautiful Lycimnia, the beloved
of hia patron.
