Onu XIV.

Os, Romans! Caesar, who had sought ·

Like Hercules in distant Spain
The palm by death and danger bought,

Returus in triumph home again.

Let Livia, joyful in her spouse,
Το each celestial fane repair3 ·

And Caesar’s sister join her vows,
Graced with the chaplet in her heir.

And grateful for their country’s gain,
Let the glad matrons’ praise be heard!

But ye! oh, thoughtless youths! refrain
From jeering lsugh or careless word.

This festive day from me shall clear

All gloomy thoughts 3 no violent fate
Nor civil tumult shall 1 sear,

While Caesar rules the Roman state.
