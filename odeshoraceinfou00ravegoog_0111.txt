ODE XXIII.

TO CHLOE.

Yon fly me, Chloe! like a vegrent sewu,
Tracing the footprints of its parent deer

Through each sequestered path and mazy lewn,
While woods and winds excite a causeless sear.

For should the aspen quiver to the breeze,
Or the green lizards rustIe in the brake‚

It bounds in vague alarm among the treeS,
Its hem-pulse flutters and its fibres quake.

Yet not as tigers do Ι follow you,
Or Libyan lion, to destroy your charms 3
Then cease to linger in a mother's view,
And learn the rapture of a Iover's arms.

Nov. 1830.
