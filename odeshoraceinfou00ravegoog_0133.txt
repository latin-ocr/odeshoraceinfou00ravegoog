ODE XXIX.

TO Iccms.

lccmS, thou enviest now th’ Arabian’s gold, ·
And meditating war and spoil
'Gainst Saba’s yet unconquered soil,
Thou forgest settara for the Median bold;

Tell me what barbarian maid,
Torn from Sheikh or Emir alain,
All in graeeful weeds arrayed,
Captive shall attend thy hrain?
What youthful page of beauty rare,
With jewelled vest and persumed hair,
Skilled with paternal bow to wing
The arrow from its twanglng string,
Like Ganymede, shall offer up
The sherbet in a golden cup?
Who aster thia shall dare deny
That streame may change their course,

And Tiber from the main run dry,
Remounting to his source ;
