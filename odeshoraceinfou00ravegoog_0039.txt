ODE III.

ΤΟ THE SHIP wmcn GARRIED VIRGIL
ΤΟ GREEOE.

Tfflm may the Goddess Queen of Cyprus, thee
The heavenly twins of Leda born,
Protect across the rolling sea
From fading eve to rosy morn3
And thee the King of Tempests guard
From sunken roek and breaking ware
(All winde save Zephyr being barred
Within his mountain cave),
Fair Ship! that bear'st my Virgil o'er
To distant Athens' classic shore,
Preserve him to his longing friends, and save
My soul's far dearer half from an untimely grave.

His breast was surely fortified

With triple bars of oak and hrum,
Who first upon the stormy tide

Ventured his fragile barli to guide,
And dared the distant main to pass3
