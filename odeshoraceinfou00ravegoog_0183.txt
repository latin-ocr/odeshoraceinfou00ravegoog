Ah! never think such generous blood
Derived from the plebeian throng3

That one so faithful, fair, and good,
To a base mother can belong.

I praise her lovely face and form,

But calm, my friend, your jealous fears3
Dream not that passion still can warm

A heart that numbers forty years,

OBSERVATIONS.

’ In this Ode the Poet, instead of rebnking his friend
Xanthias for his attachment to a girl os humble birth, rather
pleasantly encourages him, by citing a list of illustrious
names who had displayed a similar weakness. The compli-
ments paid to the gentle object os his friend’s lore in the
fourth and fifth stanzas are very grneesully expressed.

Moy, 1841.
