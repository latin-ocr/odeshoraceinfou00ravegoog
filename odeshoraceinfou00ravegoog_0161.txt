ODE XXXVII.

ΤΟ HIS commotis.

(m Fazzofcleopatra.)

’T is now our time to drink, and beat
The ground with merry feet ;
And deck the proud abodes
Of Rome's presiding Gods
With laurel garlandS‚ and with offelings meet!
One hardly dared to broaeh the cask,
Or fill with generous wine the flask,
So long as that Egyptian Quem,
Led by her pammour, was seen
To plot the Roman Empire’s fall,
And min to the Capitol.
she, mih her base degenemte crevi,
All unrefloeting in her hate,

ἱ llud iared revive such hopes anew,

Ι With Fortuno's cup intoxicate!

Wlwu stwriug pam infun Νῖκαι,
