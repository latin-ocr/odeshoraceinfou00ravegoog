332 nnn oons or nomon. Boon m.

The jovial Bardo who love the Muse
The Muses’ number ne'er refuse,
While the sweet Graues who abhor
The strife of oups und wordy war,
Lest wine and friendship disagree
Contine their votaries to three.

But frenzy fires me now-the bowl
Works its full influenoe on my soul;
Why sleeps the Berecynthian flute?
Why ore the pipe's shrill breothings mute?
Why hange the lyre upon the wall?

Ι hate a thrifty festival.

Then soatter roses on your bruun,
Let Lycus with his ill-matohed sponse

, The aged Lycus hear our joy,
And wish himself again a boy.
To thee all bright with flowing hair
And beaming like young Hesper’s star
The willing Rhode gives her charms,
Me Glycera’s fair image warnis.

OBSERVATIONS.

ln this Ode he pleasantly rollies Telephus upon his pe-
dentio devotion to ancient history and Greek studies—hiddiug
him rather join o jolly party with the Augur Murena and
spend the night iu rerelry.

Ort. 1851.
