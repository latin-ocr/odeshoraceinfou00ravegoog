Yet time could Priam’s woes assuage,
And soothe his sisters' moen

For Troilus: the Pylian sege

Wept not through all his sinking age
His much-loved hero son.

Thon dry your tears, and render thanks ⁴
Once more at peace with Heaven3
While conquering Caesar thins the ranks
Parthian and Mede, beyond the banks
Of old Euphrates driven.

With him ascend Niphates' scaur,
Thence view his godlihe course,

Where the Gelonian tribes afar
In narrowed bounds protract the war,
And wheel their panting horse.

OBSERVATION S.

Horace exhorta his friend and brother poet Valgius to
rouse himself from his inconsolable grief at the loss of his
beloved Mystes, and to divert his melancholy by singing the
recent victorico ol Augustus in the regione beyond Euphrates.

Apa, reas.
