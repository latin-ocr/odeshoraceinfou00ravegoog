On Daedslesn wings Ι soar,
And steer my tuneful flight
Where Hellespontio billows roar
’Mid stroits and islands bn'ght3
My song shall oharm the world from Afrio's coast
To serthest fields of Hyperboreon frost

To Colchis and the Gelon's tribe the lay
of triumph shall be known 3

Me shall Iberia lenrn, and they
Who drink the arrowy Rhone;

The Deoian flying in dlssembled sear

Of Marsian ohlvnlry my strnin shall hear.

Be no funereal weiling heard,

Let no vain incense burn
Above the spot where lies interred
The Poet’s vaoant urn ;
Compose all idle olsmour, nor presumo
To rear superfluous honours on my tomb.

OBSERVATIONS.

He oonolndos the Seoond Book with a note ol triumph.
Somng in tho guise ol n owen beyond tho resoh of vulgar
onvy end abore, ho predicto thot his strnins shall visit all
oountries end survive throughout oll eges, Tho ninoteenth
oontnry now bears witness to the truth ol this prediction.
