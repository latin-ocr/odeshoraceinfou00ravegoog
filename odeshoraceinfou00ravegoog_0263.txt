ODE ΙΙ.

Tmo Roman youth privation’s pain
Should learn betimes oo bea1⁴3

In war the soldier’s toil sustam,

And drive the Parthian o'er the plain
In ssight before his spear:

And pass his life in campa and dare .
Th' extremes of heat and oold.

Him from th’ opposing rampart’s square

Matrons and maids beleaguorad thero ·
With terror oft behold ;

And oft with long-drawn siglas invoke
The shelten'ng aid of Heaven3
Lest their young sponse, with heedless stroke,

The vengeful lion’s rago provoke
Through blood and slaughtor driven.
