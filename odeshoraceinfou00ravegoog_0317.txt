ODE X.

ΤΟ LYcE.

Ir wedded'to a Scythian mate

You sought the Tanais' frozen shore,
You’d surely gn'eve to see me weit

A suppliant, Lyce, at your door.

Herk to the tempest's wintry sound,
Through leafless grove and desert street 3
See how the keen night-air has bound
The mingling showers of snow and eleet.

Ungreteful Lyce, lay aside—

Lest Fortune's wheel revolving change-
This eold disdain, this eruel pride,

Or dread the Queen of Love's revenge.

Venus harh ne’er encouraged thee

Το treet thy suitor’s prayer with scorn3
And live like chaste Penelope,

Albeit of Tusean parents born.
