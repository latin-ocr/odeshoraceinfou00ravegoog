ODE XXXV.

TO marona.

Dannn GoddesS, that in Antium hold’st thy
Poteiiih abase the proud, exalt the lon,

And to convert the triumph’s passing show
To moekery, disappointment, and defeat!
The anxious husbandmen to thee

Appeala for sunshine or for shower3
And tossing on th' Icarian sea,
Th’ adventurous merchant ost invokes thy
power.
Thee the fierce Daeian and the nomade hosts
Eneamped in Scythian deserta, fear;
And states and eities and proud Latium’s coasts,
And mothers of barbarian kings revere,
And tyrants tremhle when thy name they hear,
Lest with injurious blow thou thrust
The shapely column to the dust,
