small is the difference between
Virtue concealed and buried sloth;
And, Lollius, thut oblivion's screen
Thy labours should obscure, full loth
We1e I, who celebrate thy nume
In peges spread for future fame!

Thine is a spirit prompt to dure

The toils and confliets of the state3
In eounsel prudent, breve in war,

In every change of fortune great3
Firm, upright, and un'daunted still,
In each extreme of good or ill.

Th’ avenger of detected fraud, ⁴
And peculations long untold‚
Thyself untempted by the gawd
And glitter of seductive gold;
And Consul, not for one bn'ef year
Of short-lived sway, but oft as e’er

A just and virtuous judge may dure
The Stoic’s maxim to maintain3
Rejeeting with a losty air
The eulprit's bribe, the selfish gain3
Victorious over all his foes,
Though faetious multitudes oppose.
