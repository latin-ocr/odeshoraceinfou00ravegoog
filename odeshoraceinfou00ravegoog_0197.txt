ODE VIII.

TO BARINE.

Rem! if some vengeance dread

Fell on your trebly·perjured head,
Did but a single tooth οι· nail

Turn blech, I might believe your tale!

But still the oftener that yehr dare

To outrage Heaven with oaths, more fair
That face becomes, and still the more
Admirers thicken and adore.

It answers then to treat with scorn

A parent’s ashes, and suborn

The silent stars and heavenly powers,
To favour falsehood such as yours.

For Venus laughs at woman’s wiles;
The Graces leugh, and cupid smiles
All as he barbs his glowing darts

On whetstone red with bleeding hearts.
