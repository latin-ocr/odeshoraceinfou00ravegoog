ODE XIII.

ΤΟ m nannum rom.

Brannsmr Fount! where many a fiower
Refleeted in thy margin blows3

Before t0·m0rr0w’s twilight hour
Duly to thee I'll pay my voye.

A wanton kid with created head

For love or war prepared in vain,
Shall with his life-blood newly shed
Thy pure and sparkling current stain.

When seorehing Sirius fiereest glows,
Or noentide Phoebus’ eultry beam,

Their languid limbs the herde repose
Beside thy coel refreshing stream.
