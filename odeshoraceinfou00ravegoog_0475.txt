More sacred I may dare to say

Than even my own natal day,

Whose dawning beam Ι hail with mirth,
That gave my loved Maecenas bhth.
Young TelephuS, whom now you try
To captivate with wauton eye,

A rich and hendsome girl detains

Close bound· with no unplensing chains.
Forbear to feed presumptuous thought,
By Phaethon'e example taught,

And that winged eourser who east down
The earth-born knight, Bellerophon.
That you may fitting things pursue‚
Nor keep ambitione hopes in view,
Avoid th' unequal match, and come
Invited to a meaner home.

Approaoh, my lost and dearest love,
(For other damsel ne'er shall move
This soul to transport) come and sing
Upon thy lute’s enehanting string, ’
And the sweet strain till night prolong,
For eanken‘ng cares are soothed by song.

May 7, 1853.
