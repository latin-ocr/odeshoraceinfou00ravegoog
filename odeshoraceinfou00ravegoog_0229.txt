.———.

Seant was the private wealth of yore,
But plentiful the common store;
No stately porticoes
Might then obstruet the way to meet
Eaeh summer breeze that down the street
A grateful freshness hlows.

Nor would a Roman crowd disown

Turf seats sortuitously strown;
But theu our fathers saw

At publio eost proud eities reared,

And sanes for holy rites repaired
With fresh-hewn stone by law.

OBSERVATIONS.

lnever travel down the Greet Northorn line ol reilwey
without being reminded ol the first stanza ol this Ode.
Horaoo sneers at the luxuries of odraueed eivihwtion, und
regrots the rude simplieity of a former ego.

Maseli, 1842.
