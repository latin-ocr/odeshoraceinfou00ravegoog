432 rsuoonsor nomon. soon

What mortcl knows if ere tomorrow's sun
His thread of life may not he spun?

And then the wasteful heir will scatter wide
The gold each liberal hand supplied.

When thou ort gone, Torquatus, when the lost
Shorp peng is o'er‚ ond judgmcnt past

By Minos' stern implacshle decree,
How vain thino eloquence shall be,

Thy piety, and ancient lineage vain,
A moment’s respite to obtain.

Since neither choste Diana from the ¹grove
The pure Hippolytus could save,

Nor Theseus burst dull Lethe’s chain thnt bound
Pirithous in tho durh profound.

OBSERVATIONS.

The theme os this Ode may bo hriefly told by quoting s
single couplet :-

“ Immortalis ne speres monet Annus, et almum
Quoe rupit Horo diem.''

As the Hesthen Poot hod no cortun hope beyond tho
grove, he con hold out no more comfort to Torqustus after
dcuth than he could to Sextius in o former end similer Ode.

The phrase

“Cum semel occideris, ot de te splendido Minos
Fecen't arbium?

seems to ho penned in o hals-moching scepticol spirit.

Apro, 1835.
