ODE ΙΙΙ.

ΤΟ MELPOMENE.

H1n once in youth beheld by thee
With placid eye, Melpomene,

No Isthmion effort lifts to fame

Skilled in th' arena’s dangerous gome 3
No steed amid the Olympion throng
Whirls him with matohless speed along 3
Nor, having iamed of kings the pride
And made their lofty threnis subside,
Bears him in orown of Delos' grove
To Fane of Capitolino Jove.

But streams by Tivoli that flow

And woodo that thickly wave below,
shall all his soul with song inspiro
And soothe him with AEolian Lyre.—
The sono of Rome, the City Queen,

Plaoe me among the ehoir serene
Of Bardo that in her circle sing, .
And Envy hides her venomed sting.
