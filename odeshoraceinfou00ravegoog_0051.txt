Thrice wretched they, deluded and betrayed,
Who trust thy glittering smile and Siren tongue!
Ι have escaped the shipwreek, and have hung

In Neptune’s Fene my dripping vest displayed

With votive tablet on his altar laid,

Thanking the Sea-God for his timely aid.

OBSERVATION S.

This inimitable Ode hasbeen rendered famousin English
literature by Milton's version.

At the risk of provoking unfriendly remarks from that
class ef critice who take the sale course of founding ell their
approval upon ecknowledged excellence and authority, I must
repeat the opinion expressed in my Prefaee, that this single

, effert of our greatest poet, in the wey of translation, is a

failure.
