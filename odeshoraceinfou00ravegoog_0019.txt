rendered the meaning of his author; but he
seems to me very deficient in the poetical

generally his versification is so rugged, and

whether, indeed, I may have succeeded
better than my predecessor, the judgment of
a disceming public will decide. I have at
least not hastily or carelessly obtruded these
versions on its notice, nor neglected the
precept of my author in his “Art of Poctry,’'
having laid them by for many a long year

before venturing into·print :-

“Si quid tamen olim
Scripsen‘s, in Metti descendat judicis aures
Et patris, et nostras, nonumque prematur in armum!
