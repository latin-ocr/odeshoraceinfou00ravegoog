Or celebrate the high renown
Of Ariadne’s stellar crown‚
Or Pentheus' ruin tell
Whose towers were crumbled into dust3
Or how by retribution just
Lycurgus blasted fell.

Rivers confess thy sway, to thee
Submits his tides the Indian sea3
Thou on the Thracian hill
Inebriate bind’st thy votary's hair
With snakes that cluster harmiess there
Obedient to thy will.

And when the impious giant train
Climbed to thy parent’s proud domain
Thou in a lion’s guise
Didst onwards msh with honid maw,
And striking with uplitted pay,
Hurl Rhoetus from the skies.

Albeit, by some esteemed more fit
For sportive dance or sprightly wit,

Still thine ascendant star
Above the fight was seen to glow,
Propitious friend, victorious foe,

The same in peace or war.
