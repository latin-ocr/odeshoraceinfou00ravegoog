Come, and forsake thy eloying store3
Thy turret that surveys from high
The smoke, and wealth and noise of Rome ;
And all the busy pageantry
That vvise men soom, and fools adore:
Come, give thy soul a loose‚ and haste the pleasures of
the poor.

Sometimes 'tis grateful to the rich to try

A short vicissitude, an'd fit of poverty ε
Α savoury dish, a homely treet,
Where all is plain, where eil is neat,

without the stately spacious roem,

The Persian carpet, or the Tyrian loom,

Clear up the cloudy foreheads of the great.

The sun is in the Lion mounted high ;
The Syrian star
Barke from afar,
And with his sultry breath infecte the shy3
The ground below is parched‚ the heav'ns above us fry3
The shepherd drives his sainting flock
Beneath the covert of a roch,
And seeks refreshing rivulets nigh :
The Sylvans to their shades rethe,
Those very shades and streame new shades and streame
requlre‚

fire.
