And gently fans his shoulders white

On which his peefumed looks alight
As Nireus fair to view-

Or that famed Phrygian shepherd torn

From Ida’s streamy slopeS, and borne
To realms of ether blue.

OBSERVATIONS.

This Ode is probably translated from the Greek. Tha
word “ inaudax” oorurs not elsewhere, and is plainly a trans-
lation of iirohpuq.

A remarkable ooniusion of tenses is observable, which may

be aoeounted for by supposing Horace to hare been translating
the Greek Aorist. The Ode begins with the future tense,—

·‘ Faqa'ea inaudax ; ”

and then the Poet, deseribing an imaginery battle abore to
take ploce between the rivale, tells us how the umpire
“Arbiter pugnae poantm nudo

Sub pede palmam
Fertur ,·’'

making by thir bold transition a future event become at onoe
a matter of past history.

'l'he beauty of Nireus ir alluded to by Homer in tho Second
Book of the “ Iliad'’ in the following lines as translated by
Pope :— '

“Three ships, with Nireus, sought the Trojan shore ;-
Nireua, whom Aglae to Charopus bore;
Nireua, in hmltlasa shape und blooming praee,
'lhe lorehest youth ol ell the Greoian raee;

Pelides only matohed his early channs;
But lew his troops, and arnoll his strength in arms.”
