Though sweeter then th' Orphesn lyre,

Thy strain the ohsrm'd onks should inspirc
To danos upon the sod,

Yet shall his life-blood nc’er again

Reanimate each torpid vein,
Chilled by that fatal rod,

With which the infernal Messenger‚
' Unused to yield and deas to prayer,
Conduots his shodowy flook:
But Patience warns us to endure
The evils that wo cannot cure,
And soothes the stunning shock.
