ODII XIII.

ro erce,

chh! the Gods have heard my vow 1
The Gods have heard me, Lyce! thou

Art ugly grown and old, and still
Would’st ape the airs of beautynovv,

And impudently johe, and drink thy fill.—
And thinkest thou half dmnk to move
With that craek’d voice the God of Love?
Like a scar'd bird the wauton (lies,

And nestles in the eheeh and eyes

Of Chia skilled in every art

To touch the lute, or touch the heart.
Thy face he shuns‚ unwilling he

To light upon a withered tree3

Shuns thee, of thy grey heirs afraid,
Thy vvrinkled brev, and teeth decayed.
Not robes of Coan purple now,

Nor Eastern jevels' varied glow
Recall the days of beauty’s prime,
Long buried in the womb of Time.
