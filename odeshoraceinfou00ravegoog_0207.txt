In adverse fortune Hope may cheer
The man, whose steadfast thought
Regards prosperity with fear;
For Jove Omnipotent ean clear
The storm himself had brought.

Calamities which threaten now
May not afflict thee long3

Sometimes Apollo smooths his brow‚

And lays aside his slaekened bow
To court the Muse with song.

In straits both bold and active be,
Nor less when favouring galea
Waft thy light vessel o'er the sea,
Do thou with prudent augury
Reef in thy swelling sails.
