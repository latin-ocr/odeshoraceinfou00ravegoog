Rather 'neoth this losty pine

Or the plane-tree’s ample shade,
Let our careless limbs recline

On the grassy carpet laid.

And vvith blooming roses crovvned

Ι Pouriug unguents on our hair,

Let us pass the gohlet round,
Bacchus enses every care!

Who shall temper in the spring
Cups of hot Falerniun wine,

Whose entreatics Lydia bring,
Easy nymph with voice divine?

Bid her hasten to the feast,
vaeeping eost her ivery lyrc,

Like a Spartan dumsel drest,
Braided locks and loose attire.

drink a bottleofwine1” So close is the correspondencc he·
tweeu Horace's noune oud human nature iu all times and ages,
