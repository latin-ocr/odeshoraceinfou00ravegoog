Fill, fill the shining goblets up,
Drown all past sorrows in the eup,
And esseneed odours freely pour
From the wreathed coneh's capacious storo!
Who' now shall first the myrtle's pride,
Or who the modest parsley twine?
Who at the festive board preside,
And pledge our toasts in flowing wine? Ι
No Thracian rev’ller’s frantie cheer
Our marry-making shall transcend,
For sure that day is doubly dear
That welcomes back a long-lost friend!
