ODE VIII.

ΤΟ MAECIINAS.

WHAT Ι a bachelor should do

With garlands, frankineense‚ and rue,
And turfen altars crowned with fire,
Maeeenas, you may well admire,
Versed as you are in all the mles
Taught in the Greek and Roman schools‚
And not unwitting of the way

Το keep this Kalend's holiday.

Know that Ι, nearly killed of late,

By a huge plane-tree's falling weight,
To Bacchus vowed a milk-white goat,
With pious offen’ngs duly brought.

On this day's feast the aare be mine
To broaeh a jar of mellowed wine,
Whose genereus vintage bears the date
Of Plancus' second Consulate.

Come then, MaeeenaS, hither wend

To drink a bumper with your ffiend;

Our wakeful lampa shall burn till day,
And noise and anger flee away.
