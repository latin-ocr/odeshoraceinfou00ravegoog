And, lo! great Oaesar from his deek

Urges his rowers to the ehase,
Where saved alone amid the wreek,
The Queen bewildered flies apaee;
As through the clouds in middle air
The falcon pounoes on the dove3
Or Thracian hunters drive the hare
Trembling through Haemonia's grove ;
So thought our leader to secure his spoil,
And bear her off in chains to far Italia's soil.
But she whose spirit proud and high
Refused to brook indignity,
N o womanly alarm betrayed
At dagger's point and gleaming blade;
Nor sought the eovert of the eoast
For refirge when the day was lost3
,But with unruffled visage dared
Her ruined palaee to regard3
And fearless elasped that fatal worm
Whose subtle venom did defile
Her royal blood and glorious form,
Sovereign o'er all the realms of Nile!
Haughty in her deliberate death ἱ
And ohoosing rather to resign her breath
Than live the prize of her victorious foe,
And grace in gilded bonds a Roman triumph's
show.
