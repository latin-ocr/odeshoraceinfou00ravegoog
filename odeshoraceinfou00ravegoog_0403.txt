380 'rna onas or noanon. Boon m.

Thou, what befits the new Lord Maym,
And what the city factions dare,
And what the Gallie arms will do,
And what the quior-bearing foe,
Art anxiously inquisitive to know ε
But God has wisely hid from human sight
The dark decrecs of future fate,
And sown their seeds in depth of night ;
He laughs at all the giddy turns of state;
When mortals search too soon, and sear too late.

Enjoy the present smiling hour,

And put it out of fortune’s pow’rt
The tide of business, like the running stream,
Is sometimes high, and sometimes low,
Α quiet ebb, or a tempestuous flow,
And always in extreme.
Now with a noiseless, gentle course
It keeps within the middle bed;
Anon it lifts aloft the head,
And bears down all before it with impetuous force 3
And trnnks of trees come rolling down,
Shecp and their folds together drown:
Both house and homosteads into seas are borne;
And rocks are from their old foundations torn,
And woods, made thin with winds, their scattered honours
