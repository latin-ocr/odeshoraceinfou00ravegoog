Nou possidentem multa vocaveris
Recte beatum; rectius occupat
Nomen beati, qui Deorum
Muneribus sapienter uti
Duramque callet pauperiem pati 3
Pejusque leto flagitium timet:
Non ille pro caris amicis
Aut patria timidus perire.

Oneravarrous (watinucd).

plainly proves this. lollius became the object of dislike ιο
'liberins3 and he was of course abnsed by Velleius Pater·
culus (lib. ii. c. 97, 102). Pliny subsequently joined in this
abuse (Nat. Hist. ix. 35), and Tacitus (Anu. iii. 48)
represents Tiberius as finding fault with lollius for wanting
that very integrity and lofty scorn of corruption, for the pos-
session of which Horace, in this Ode, has bestowed on him so
noble a panegyric. The evidence of Horace as a contemporary
and competent witness is sufficient to outweigh all subsequcnt
and opposing testimony.

lbere is a passage ol considerable obscurity in this Ode,
from v. 39, “ Consulquo non unius anni,” to r. 44, “ sua victor
arma.” The meaning of it is probably this t—lollius was
really Consul, ac. 21 ς but Horace says that au npright aud
honourable “ judex ” is always as great as the greatest magis-
trate: such was Lollius, a man above corruption: not ιο be
intimidated hythe menaces of an opposiug mob: not to he
bribed by the weelth of the worthless.

No Ode does more honour ιο the moral comage, or speaks
more highly for the manly sincerity of the friendship ol' Horace:
few do higher honour ιο his poetical powers.
