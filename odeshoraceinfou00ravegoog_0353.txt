ODE XIX.

ΤΟ nonnullus.

Or dotes you eite an endless chain
From Inachus to Codrus’ reign,
Thot sels-devoted king who fell

A martyr to his country’s weal;
And then you prate, Ο Telephus,
About the raee of AEoeus,

And battles fought and trophies won
By th' wall of secred Ilion.

But of the priee we pay for wine

Of Chion or Falernian vine,

Who the warm bath may hesi prepare,
Or shield us from the nipping nir

Of Apennine on winter’s day

You nothing know, and nothing say.

Cournge, my friend! drink fair, fill up
One bumper in the brimming oup

To the new moon's returning light,
Another to the dark midnight,

A third to greet the rising morn

In honour of Murena born.

See how we pour the purple wine

In goblets three or goblets nine,
