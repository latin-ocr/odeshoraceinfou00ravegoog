ODE V.

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS· ι

Ο anon from Gods propitious sprung,

Best guardian of our land, too long
Thine absence here we mourn;

The sacred Conclave of the state

Thy welcome promise still await3

Redeem it, and return.

Restore, Ο gracions Prinne, the light
Of dawn unto thy country's night;
For when thy face benign
Like spring, hath met thy people’s gaze,
More pleasantly pass by the days,
The suns more gaily shine.

As yearns a mother for her son,

Her sailor-boy, whose honroward run
Some unpropitious star

Hath 0st delayed‚ or N otus' blast

Beyond Mount Carpathus hath east,
From home and kindred far ;
