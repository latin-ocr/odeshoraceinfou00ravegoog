ODE II.

ΤΟ ANTONIUS IULUS.

Wnoe’ER, Iulus, dares aspiro

To rival the Pindarie Lyre,
But soars on Daedalean plume,

And flaps his wax-bound wings in vain,
Like Icarus to find a tomb

Beneath the glassy main,
Leaving a name the tale to tell,
Of what he dared, and whence he fell.-
As the swoln stream from mountains freed
Bursts 0’er its banks, and sweeps the mead,
The fervid tide of Pindar’s song
Boils with impetuous might along.

Worthy his brow Apollo's wreath to wear,
Whether in Dithyrambics bold
Of phrase unused the march is rolled‚

And looser numbers cheat the ear;
