oor v. Q. uomrn mecm olemus. 423

Condit quisque diem collibus in suis,

Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores ;

Hinc ad vina redit laetus, et alteris
Te mensis adhibet deum:

Tc multa prece, te prosequitur mero
Defuso pateris; et Laribus tuum
Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris

Et magni memor Herculis.

Longas ominem, dux bone, ferias

v Praestos Hesperiae, dicimus integro

Sicci mone die, dicimus uvidi,

Cum sol Oceano subest.

OBSERVATIONS.

In beautifully flowing verse, he gives un uffoctionote wel-
oome to Augustus on his expected return to Rome from Gaul
after a three years’ absence. This strcin seems really to pro·
ceed from tho heart, and thus is sermore touching than the
funoiful and hyperbolical adulation offered up to the Imperial
authority in other Odes.

The feelings herc expressed are real, and cll the imoges
natural and truc, offering themselves tothe mind spontaneously,
and produced without effort or artifice.
