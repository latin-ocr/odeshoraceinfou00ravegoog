She wearies Heaven with prayers and spella,
And with fixed gaze for ever dwells
Upon the winding shore ;
Smit with like faithful, fond desires,
Thy yearning country now requires
To see her King once more.

our noan and nera in safety feel,
While yellow Ceres deeks the mead,
And Fonune eounta her gains3 <

The sailor skims the tranquil sea,
And unabashed Fidelity
Imputed guill disdaina

By thee our matrons’ homes are pure,

Th' approving father owns secure
His likeness in his son3

Morals and Law maintain 'their away,

And J ustice stopa the eulprit’s way ⁷
Soon ae the crime is done.

Who now need sear the Parthian swerd,
’ ¹ Or frozen Scythia's aavage horde?
Who cares for rebel Spain,
Or wild Germania’s children fierce,

While Caesar rules the universe
With mild but steady rein?
