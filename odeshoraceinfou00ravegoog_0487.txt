ODE XIV.

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS.

How shall the Senate's or the people’s cure
With honours worthy of thy titles raise
Fit monument, Ο Caesar, to thy praise?
Or how extol thy fame and virtues rure,
Greatest of princes 1 o'er each land supreme,
Where’er the sun displuys his universal bearn?

Late the Vindelio savage felt thy sword,
When Drusus his undnunted legions led
'Gainst tribes that ne'er had owned a Roman lord,
And Brenni swift and fieroe Genaunian bled,
And Alpine cliffs reeohoed to the sound
of rosh-built castles levelled to the ground.

Nor less the elder Nero dared‚
When rushing to the fight

He smote the Rhaetian's ginnt guard

With their devoted bosoms bared
Το death for Freedom's right.
