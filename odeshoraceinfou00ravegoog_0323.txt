300 mn oens on nonncn. Boon 111.

Although an hundred snakes uprear
Their venomed eoils around him flung,

And poisonous foam and gore besmear
His shaggy throat and triple tongue.

Ixion tested on his wheel,

And Tityos' tortured visnge smiletl3
The Danaid maids forgot to fill

Th' exhausted urn, by thee beguiled.

Lydia, from thee the virgin's guilt
From thee the punishment shall know

Deereed for all the blood they spilt,
In regions of eterna] woe.

Oh, impious maidsl for how could they
Devise a crime more dark and dread!

The impious maids had hearts to slay
Their husbands in the bridal bed.

But one alone of that fell band
Shrank from those nuptial rites abhorred3

Defied her perjured sire's command,
And nobly false, preserved her lord.

“ Awahe !” she eried3 “ ense, my dearest!
“ Haste end elude thine impious foes3

“ Lest from a hand thou little fearest
“ Etennal be this night’s repose*

“Nox tibi, ni properas, ista perennis erit.’'-0vin.
