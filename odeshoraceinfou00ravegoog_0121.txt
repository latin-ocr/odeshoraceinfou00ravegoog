ODE XXVI.

ΤΟ AEmos LAMIA.

I, ΒΥ tho Muses loved, oonsign

To winde that sweep tho Cretan brine,
Corroding coros and fears unblest
That robbed my bosom of its rest.
Caroless am Ι what monaroh reigns

Supremo o'er Scythia's frozon ploinS,
Or whether Tiridatos’ sword

shall yield to Parthia's tyrant lord.

Do thou, sweot Muse! whom fountains bright
And pure Castalian rills delight,
Weavo for my Lamia's brow the crown
Of flowers on banks Pierian blown3
without thee vain is all renown.

Thon lot me give to doathloss fame
Tho honours due to Lamia’s namo,
And come, ye Choir of Sisters nino,

To consecrate this song of mine!

Jao. 1840.
