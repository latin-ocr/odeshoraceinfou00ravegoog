ΤΗΕ ODES OF nomon. BOOK 1.

¹ Nor feared the rege of warring winds
Upturning the rebellious sene,
And steered through nightly mist that blinds
’ To mortal ken each fn'endly star,
The pilot's beacon from afar,
Arcturus or the Pleiades,
Him could no forms of death affright,
Who viewed with steadfast heart and sight
The wallowing monsters of the ocean,
And watched the melancholy night,
While winds and waves in wild commotion
Howled round th' Acroceraunian steep‚
Where many a broken hee] betrays the trea-
cherous deep.

In vain bath God's all-wise deeree
Cleft the broad earth with trncldess sea,

If ships in bold defianee dn'ven
Cross the dread gulf ordained by Heaven.

Mankind, still eager to transgress,
Rush through forbidden wiehedness3
Prometheus' daring soul
By fraud approached the beams that ehone
Around great J ove's eternal throne,
And fire celestial stole.
