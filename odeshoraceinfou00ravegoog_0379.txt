ODE XXV.

ΤΟ BACCHUS.

Wmnnna, O Bacchus, am I borne
Full of thy recent influence?
To what wild woodS, and caves forlorn

Doth my cnraptured sense
Tranaport me, there to meditate
On Caesar’s high Imperial state,
Exalt hia glory 'mid the stans to chine,
And rank his godlike name among the powers divine?

ΙἸΙ tell of themes unknown, unsnng
By other mind, by other tongue‚
Into th' Ideal rapt—as when
The Bacchanal, in some deep glen
By Hebrus’ fount uproused‚ surveys
The Thracian woods in wild amane,
The snowy hills and wilderness sublime
And Rhodope's far cliffa which barbaroua footsteps climb.
