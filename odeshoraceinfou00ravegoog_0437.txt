“ Not severed Hydra reared her erest ·
“ More fierce against Alcides' breast,

“ Nor Colchis saw more numerous iise,

“ Nor Thebes, her earth-born prodigies.

“ The deeper sunk, the fairer still

“ Behold her rise invincible3

‘⁶ Though oft defeated, future days

“ These ware shall sing in deathlese lays,

‘⁴ When matrone stoid¹ and virgins fair

‘⁶ shall say their spouse or sire was there.

“ To Carthago ne'er again shall I

“ Send heralde proud of victory!

“ Our sweiling hopes, our lofty fortunes fall
“ Destroyed with thee, unhappy Asdmbal!
“ The Claudian raee still guards their lond,

“ Whom mighty J ove’s propitious star ’
“ And Wisdom's calm sagacious hand
“ Guide through the narrow straits, and perilous rocks
of war.''
