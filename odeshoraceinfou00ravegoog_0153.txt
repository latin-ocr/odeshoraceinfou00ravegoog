130 333 omos 03 303333. 3003 1.

And rouse the slumbering people with th' alarms
Of 1131 1333113033 3311, “To arms ! to arms !''
Before 1133 Destiny holds on her course,
Bearing aloft the emblems of her foree;
The massive 3311310 311331 her purpose dread,
The wedge and rivet firm, and molten lead.
But Hope and Faith 3111 snowy robes, attend
Thy stepS, oh F ortune 1 nor renounee their
friend,
Although with vesture changed thou quit the
door,
Where Wealth and Power thy parting steps
deploro.
Not 30 113 fickle vulgar3 they
With sycophants and herlots fly,
Unskilled to bear 113 yoke‚ nor stay
Τ111 113 1331 flagon's dregs are dry.
Oh, Goddess! favour with benignant smile
Great Caesar’s march to Britain's distant Isle,
And save the flower of Roman Youth afar
Engaged in Eastern spoil and lndian war.

Alas, our country shames us! we are stained
With civil oonfliet and our brother’s blood!
From what in 1113 hard age have we refrained?
What 3133 avoided, or what vioe withstood?

Have youth upon their 3311033 kept 3 guard
Through godly seor, or sanes and altars spared?
