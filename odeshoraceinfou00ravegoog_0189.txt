ODE VI.

ΤΟ SEPTIMIUS.

smnus 1 that with me wouldst share
The toil of travel, to the shore

Of Gades, or those quieksands where
The Mauritanian billows roar3

Thy friend, with war and wandering faint,
Now prays that Tibur’s ancient seat
Reared by the Argive emigrann
Be to his age a enlm retrent3

Or let me seek Galesus’ rills
(If this the envious Fates withhold)‚
Sweet to the flocks that range the hills
Where breve Phalanthus reigned of old.

That nook retired, that sunny soil
Beyond all others, smiles on me,
Whose olive-groves Venafrum’s oil,
Whose hives can match th' Hymettian bee.
