Here bring the perfumeS, bring the wine!
And round thy brow fresh roses twine
Ere yet their bloom be fled;

Or ere the Potes, stern Sisters three,
Have past th' immutable deeree
To cut Life’a slender thread.

Then must thou leave thy lands and home,
Thy noble villa’s lofty dome,
And Tiber murmuring nigh3
Resign thy groves and gardens fair,
To gratify thy longing heir
With riehes heaped on high. ,

What now are titles‚ wealth, or fame,—
The glories of ancestral name?
Alike the rioh, and they
That starve in wintry snows, or sweat
Beneath the sultry Dog·star's heat,
Relentless Fato obey.

We all must pass that dreaded bourne

From whence no travellers retum;
And all alike explere

Early or late those regions dark,

Where Charon plies his fatal bark
'1¹0 th' undisoovered shore.

Moy, 1841.
