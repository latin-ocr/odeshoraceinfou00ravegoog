ODE IV.

Dnscnnn from heaven, Calliope! and bring
Queen of the Muses, or thy tnneful lule,
Or lively pipe‚ or harp vvith golden string,
Or thine own thrilling voice no longer mute

In deathless harmony with me to sing l-
Heard ye the strnin? or do fantastic dreams

Delude my sensesl for Ι seem to rove
Through the dim mazes of some sacred grove
By fragrant gales refreshed and trichling streame.
Me yet a child when on Apulia’s hills
-Asleep I lay, fatigued wilh summer sport

(A truant boy, well pleased to roam

Beyond the threshold of my nurse’s home),
The mod-<loves bringing flowerets in their bills
Covered wilh foliage green, that so nnhurt
By bear or venomed snake, in those sweet hovers
I slumbered allthe sultry noontide hours.
