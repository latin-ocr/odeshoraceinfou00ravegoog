Were needed, thou, my friend, wouldst not

Regard unmoved my altered lot,
Should adverse Fate befall.

The eovetous is greedy still;
He only lives from every ill
Securo, to whom suspicions Heaven
Cantent with competendo hath given.

OBSERVATIONS.

Here he first shows the power ol wealth and the evils that
hare sprung from eovetousness in divers instaures. From
this viee he declares himself exempt; and, in the absence os
actual poverty, is perfectly content with tho moderate oom-
peteneo bestowed hy Providenee.

The three examples given of fatal ooretousness in the
third and fourth stanzas allude-1. To the augur Amphiaraus,
whose hiding-plaoe was rerealed by his wife Eriphyle, brihed
by a neeklaoe of gold and jeuels. 2. To Philip of Macedon,
who is supposed to hare conquered as many sities by gold as
by soree ol arms. 3. To tho traitor Menas, Praefoet ol tha
Fleet of Sextus Pompey, who was brihed by Augustus to
desert his master.
