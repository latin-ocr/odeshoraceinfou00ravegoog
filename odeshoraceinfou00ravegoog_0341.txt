ODE XVI.

TO MAECENAS.

A 13th fonress, strongly barred
With door and stanchion‚ and a guard
Of waheful dogs, had long immured
The virgin Danah, secured

From midnight wantons bold :
But Jupiter and Venus laughed
At old Acrisius’ futile craft3
For safe the path, and easy trod,
That lay before th’ enamoured God

· Converted into gold.

That gold! that gold! which loveth well
To pass by gate and sentinel!
And keener than the lightning's shock
To penetrate the guarded roch3

The Argive augur lost

His home and life from lucre’s thirst3
By brihes the Macedonian burst
Through forts, and rival kings o'erthrew3
And bribes ensnared the venal crew

Of Pompey’s naval host.
