ODE XXVII.
no aannnnn.

Lnn omens lead the wiched on their way,
Such aa a pregnant hound, 01· chattering jay,
Or tawny wolf, or yelping fox
Prowling from Lanuvium's rochs3
Or let a snake the purposed journey stay,
1f like an arrow darting
Athwart the path at starting,
He send th' affrighted mules and drivers far astray?
But why should my prophetie mind
To augur evil be inclined,
Since, Galatea, for thy sake
At early morning’s dawn l wahe
And gneet with pray’rs the rain-foreboding crow
Ere to the marsh she flies croahing her note of woe?
Oh! be thou blest where’er thou art,
Mindful of me, although we part,
And suffer not th’ ill-omened jay,
Or wandering erow, to bar thy way.
Yet see, Orion's studded belt
In twinhling vapour seems to melt;
l’ve seen blach Hadn'a’s swelhng wave,
I’ve seen the gulf where white squalls rave,
