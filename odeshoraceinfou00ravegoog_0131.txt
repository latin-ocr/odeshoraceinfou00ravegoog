OBSERVATION S.

In my judgment, this is a wonderful composition, audone
which, in point of variety and ingenuity, may rank with any

Ode of the four Boohs. It is founded upon that very ancient
and widely-diffused belief, that the rites of interment may be
supplied by scattering three handfuls of dust upon the nn-
bnried corpse3 and the passing mariner is implored hythe
shade of Archytas not to neglect this indispensable duty. He
is promised a successful voyage in ease of his complianoa; he
is threatened with mischief in case of refusal.

Irememher to have read in some recent publication the
account of a perilons joumey over one of tha loftiest passes of
the Andes. In a cava, at the highest part of the ascent, the
travellers discovered the corpses of several human beings, who,
being overtaken by storms, had perished among the rocks.
The native guides religiously performed the duty solicited by
Archytas, of thrioe scattering a handful of duat over each
corpse, as a sufficient substitute for the rites of interment3
showing that in all countries and in all ages a sinular sense
is found to exist of the necessity of burial and the efficacy of
its substitute.

In this Ode, which Ι am convinced was a translation or
imitation of some Greek poem now lost, tho genius of
Archytas is beautifnlly slretched in the opening lines; and
the reply of his disembodied spirit abounds with remarkable
illustrations and mysterions allusione to the doctrines of
Pythagoras

In order to render the dialoguo more intelligible, Ihave
ventured in this version to soiten the extreme abrnptness of
the transitione in the original text, and even to name that
great philosopher, who, in his own person, pretended to be a
hving instance of the metempsychosis.
