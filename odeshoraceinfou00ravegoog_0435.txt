Be witness dark Metaurus' stream ’

And Asdrubal's defeated host,

And that fair morn that shed its heom .

Of glory on the Latian coast,

And burst upon th' astonished sight,
Dispersing wide the-clouds of night.
That morn which saw fell Afrie’s son
Through our Italian eities run

Like fleme through sorests, or the breeze
Careering o'er Sicilian seas.

From thence the Roman youth amain

The prosperous path of conquest trod,
Repaired each deseerated Faue,

And gave each shrine its guardian God3
Until at length, while grief his utteranee broke,
Perfidious Hannibal despain‘ng spoke: —-

“Weak deer to ravening wolves a prey‚

“ still as we hrave these Romans, they
‘⁶ So meet ns, that our chiesest hoast

“ Is how to fly, and cheat them most.-
“ The nation‚ that from Ilion’s'fires

“ Brought off their sons, and hoary sires,
“ Their wives and household deities

‘⁴ O'er tossing seas to Latium's skies,

“ Like the lopped oak, whose leafy pride
“ Lies seattered on the mountain side,

“ Through blood and wounds maintains the strife
‘⁴ And draws new vigour from the hnife.
