Tells how a wife’s perfidious lie

Worked on the fond credulity
Of angry Proetus, swayed

To wreak his erring wrath upon

The over-oheste Bellerophon
By female arts betrayed.

What dangers compassed Peleus' head

While from the proffered love he fled
Of false Hippolyte ;
And from such tules a moral draus
That he should soorn the irksome laws
Of Truth and Chastity.

Yet ull in vain! Compose thy fears;

Deaf as th’ Iearian rocks he hears,
And faithful still remains.

But thou, Asterie! oh, beware,

Lest young Enipeus’ form ensnare
Thy heart in amorous okains l

What though no other youth moy speed
With equsl nerve the pronoing steed
Along the grassy course?

What though none else with vigorous limb
And rupid stroke can breast like him
The flooded Tiber’s force?
