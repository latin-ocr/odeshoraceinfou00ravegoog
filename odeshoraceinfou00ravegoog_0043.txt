Thence sprang a ghastly birth
Of torturing Fiends and Furios-thence
Red Plague and spotted Pestilenee‚
Fierce Fever and Consumption dire,
With Destiny herself conspire
To vex the sorrowing Earth3
And Death‚ whose step was meroifully slow,
Now dogs our dally path akeen and wabohful foe.

New patha along the azure sky,
On wings to man denied, -

The labour of Alcmena’s son

Burst tthrongh tho gates of Acheron,
And stemmed the Stygian tide.

How shall the Thunderer sleep‚ or how

Relax thet terrors of his brow?

N ought seems impossible ιο man. ¹

But Daedalus presumed to try

We climb high heaven itself‚ and soan
With bold inquiry the mysterious maze
Of God's creation‚ and tho wondrous ways
(Albeit immeas'rable to human span)
Of one Almighty Cause, one all-pervading Plan.

OBSERVATIONS.

This Paraphrase was originally addressed ιο the good

ship Barham, which bore Sir Walter Scott ιο Italy from his
nativo land. It will, probably, be criticised as too redundant.

Jan. 1831.
