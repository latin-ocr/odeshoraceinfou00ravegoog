Peion, boy, the gerlande, fetch the nard,
And pass the flowing bowl about3

If Spartacus a cask hath spared‚
saved from his predatcry rout.

And hid Neaera come this way,

Knotting her auburn lochs with speed3
But if the portet cause-delny‚

Begone, nor for her fawours plead.

Grey hair's heve rendered me sedate,
From strife and passion Ι forbear3
Time was, in Plancus' Consulem,
Such things had made me storm and sweer.

OBSERVATIONS.

Horace congratulans the Romen people upon the saie
return oi Augustus from Spain, where he hnd confronted the
double riske oi war end sickness. In the first line hc ndroitly
institutes n parallel between the success οἰ Angustus and
Hercules, who slew the icbled Geryon in the island oi Gades,
end bequeathed his name tc the two great rocks of Calpe end
Abyle, which were called the Pillnrs of Hercules. Upon these
are now sitneted the iortresses οἰ Gibrnltnr and Oentn

June, 1851.
