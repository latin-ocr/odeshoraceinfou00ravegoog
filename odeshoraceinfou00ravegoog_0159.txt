And at the feast, where roses blend
Their fragranee with the lily’s snow,
Let lovely Damalis coneend
With Bassus in the bumper’s flow.

All eyes on Damalis are fixed3
But she the closer shall entwine
Her last new love, like ivy mixed
With tendiils of the elusten'ng vine.

OBSERVATION S.

This is an allectionem and cordial greeting to his friend
Plotius Numida on his return to his native country. Itis
probable he was one ol Pompey’s party, recalled from exile by
the clemeney ol Augustus.

Feb. 1841.
