Not other than (his labours o’er)
Some pleased successful counsellor,
After a verdict, bide adieu

To legal strife and client’s crew,.
And takes his road to fair Venafrum's plain,
Or proud Tarentum’s walls, far stretching to the main.

OBSERVATIONS.

This magnificent Ode tells its own tale, and requires only
a brief notice. One remarkable feature may be pointed out as
curicus in these our days os unbounded colonication, which is,
the indelible disgrace which attached to the Roman soldier
or citizen who established himself as a settler and contracted
ties of effinity under any circumstances with the enemies of
his country, or ewen as it seems with any foreign nation.

The indignation exeited in the mind of the Poet finds vent
by recording the ancient virtue and noble patriotism oi Regn-
lus3 and the concluding stannes oi this Ode may be pro-
nouuced oqual, if not superior, to any passage in tho works of
any lyric poet.

One may be pardoned for feeling but little pleasure in the
laborious accuracy of modern inquirere, who have attempted
to convince our sober judgment that the whole story oi Re-
gulus's mission to Rome and return to Oarthsge is aiable.
1 rejoice to perceive that this incredulity is not shared by my
accomplished relative, the Dcan os Christ Ghurch, in hie re-
cently published “ History oi Rome.”

Feb. 1851.
