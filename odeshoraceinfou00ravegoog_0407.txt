For his ill-gotten gain ;
And pray to Gods that will not hear,
While the debating winds and billows bear
His weslth into the main.

Secure of what Ι cannot lose,
In my small pinnaee Ι ean sail,

And running with a merny gale,
With friendly stara my safety seek
Within some little winding oreek,
And see the storm ashore.
