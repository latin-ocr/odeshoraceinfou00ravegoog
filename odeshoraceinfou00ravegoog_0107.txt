ODE XXII.

TO ARISTIUS Fuscus.

Tan virtuous man, whose heart within
Harbours no thought of secret sin,
Needs not the Moorish areher’s craft,
Nor quiver armed with venomed shast.

Whether his weary footsteps go
O'er Afn'c's sand or Scythia’s snow‚
Or those untrodden wilds explore
By famed Hydaspes' desen shore.

' For as Ι strolled through Tibur's grove,
And sang of Lalage and love,
Unarmed, by careless fancy led,

A savage wolf my presence fled.

A monster of such giant brood

Ne'er couched in Daunia’s tangled wood,
Nor prowled on J uba’s arid plains,
Where lions toss their tawny manes,
