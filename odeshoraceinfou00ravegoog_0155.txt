Oh, Fortune, save us l and thine aid afford

To sharpen once again our blunted sword

Against the Scythian's tribe, and rebel Arab's
horde.

OBSERVATIONS.

This invocation to Fortuna is supposed by some orities to
have been written in consequence of the defeat and destruction
of the Roman legions in Gaul under the command of Quinc-
tilius Varus. But it seems difficult to reconeile the date of
that event with the probable date of this Ode, or even with
the existence of the poet. It is a grand composition, and in
this, as in many of the long Alcaic Odes, Ι have in translation
shaken off the trammels of a regular stanna, for which license
I may plead Dryden's example.

This Ode contains one passage of extreme difficulty, viz.
the picture of Fateor Destiny; the “ saeva Necessitas,” who
goes before Fortune, bearing in her brazen hand certain mys·
terious symbols, of which the meaning is uncertain. Are

they to be riewed as instrumente of punishment for those
who, having abused the good gifts of Fortune, are overtaken
by Destiny, or are they merely symbols of fixity and rmchange-
able durability? The latter interpretation seems to be fa-
vonred by a passage in the arth Ode, Book iii :-

“Si figit adamantinos
Summis verticibus dira Necessitas
Claros ; ''

and, therefore, after much reflection, Ihavo adopted it3 but
even in this instance the precise meaning is somewhat obscure.
