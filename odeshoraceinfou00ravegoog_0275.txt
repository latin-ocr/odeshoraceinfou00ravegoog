“ But let her warlike sons beware
“ Os these conditions‚ lost they dare,
’ “ Misled by pn‘de or purpose vain,
‘⁸ Troy’s ancient walls to rear again.
“ A second vengoanoe shall destroy
“ The fortunes of a second Troy ;
“ Mysolf that destiny will prove
“ The sistor ond the wife of Jove.
“ Though thrice Apollo build the wall,
“ Thrice shall the bramn hulwark fall; ,
“ Thrioo shall her widows oaptive ta‘en
“ Deplooe their sons and husbands slain.’'

But whither would the Muse aspiro?
Such thomos suit nottho sportive lyre:
Conse, bold one, to relate
Th’ inscrutable doooees of Fato,
Nor in pmumptuous verse
Tho speech of Gods rehoorse 1
Loot in the vain attempt to rise,
Thou foebly sink to earth while som'ng to the
skies.
