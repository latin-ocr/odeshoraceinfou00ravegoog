There doth the young and guileless wife
Watoh 0’er her orphaned step-son's life,
Nor doth a richlydowried spouse

Her husband rule, or deck his brows
(Allured by some rich gallant’s fame)
With tokens of a ouokold’s shame.

But virtue stands in place of dower,

And guards the sacred marriage bower-
Linlred with her sister Chastity-

. From touch impure and wand’ring eye:
Unpardoned there is breaeh of faith3
The aot abhorred, the forfeit death.

Ο, if a prinae desire t' assuage
Intestine war, and faotione ruge,

If he desire to see his name
Immortalized in future fame,

And statues raised to celebrate

The “ Father of the Roman State,'’
Let him oourageously repress
Extravagant licentiousness‚

Dear to posterity! while we
Besotted, each in his degree,

The virtue that we hold, despise,
And only when we lose it, prize.

But why lament our downward road,
When guilt unpunished stelhs abroad?
Or what can useless laws avait,
When private worth and morale fail?
