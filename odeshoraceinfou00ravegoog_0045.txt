TO SEXTIUS.

Sesea Winter leaves our southern sky,
And boats whose heels had long lain dry
Are launehed along the coast ;
The hind forsakes his chimneyhooh,
And cattle browse beside the brook,
No longer white with frost.

Now Cytherea leads the dance,

And by the quiven‘ng moonbeam’s glanee
The Nymphs and Graees' quire

With step alternate brush the dew3

While Vulean and the Cyclops’ erew
Stir up their smouldering fire.

'Tis now the time to wreathe our brows
With woodland myrtle’s glossy boughs
Or Earth's expanding flower3
And immolate in shady groves
The lamb 01· hid that Faunus loves,
As best befits the hour.
