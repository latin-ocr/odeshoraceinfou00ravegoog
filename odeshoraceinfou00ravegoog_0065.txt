ODE IX.
i

ΤΟ THALIARCHUS.

Ι She how the stom-drifts glimmer white

On far Soracte's eraggy height,
And searee the labouring woods

Sustain th’ unwonted lead oi sneiv,

While icy fetters in their flow
Arrest the silent floods 1

Oh, ThaliarehuS, pile up higher
The blazing legs upon the fire,
And thaw this wintry eold!
Then from thy cellar''s mmost shrine
Bring freely forth thy eheieest wine,
In Jars of Sabine mould 1

Whose mandate is no sooner given

To calm the raging seete,
Than straig eht the winde have eeased to pout
Their fury on the sounding shore-

We’ ll drink, and leave the rest to Heaven,
Ι
Have eeased to rend the trees!
