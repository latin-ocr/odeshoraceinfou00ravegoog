ODE XIX.

ΤΟ Bnccflus.

Rnnon'n from men in desert rude
(List, future ages) Bacchus stood
My wondering eyes before ;
While Nymphs in fixed attention mute,
And goat-heofed Fauns, with ears acute,
Imbibed his mystis lore.

F ull of the recent God I reel,
Strange horrors 0'er my senses steal,
And joy that clouds the brein.
Eune! spere me, mighty God,
Tenific with thine ivied rod,
And Dithyrambic strain.

Warmed with the energy divine,

I'll sing of rocks that gush with wine
And wanton Thyades ;

Perennial founts of foamy eneam,

And honey triekling in a stream
From trunks of hollow trees.
