ODE XXXII.

ΤΟ HIS LYRE.

ΑΜΕ, my Lyre ! if e’er we played
Sweet music in the twilight shade
That may outlive our time, again
commemorate the Latian strain,

First by the Lesbian minstrel sung,
Who, fieree in combat, yet among
His feats of arms, or while he wore
His shattered galley to the shore,

still sang of Bacchus and the joy
Of VenuS, with her blooming b0y‚

The Muse, and dark=eyed Lyeus’ hair ι
Luxuria-nt on his shoulders bare.

Oh, Lyre ! delight of gods above,
And welcome to the coms of J ove3
Sweet balm of human toil and pain,
Thee may Ι ne'er invoke in vain Ι

Feb. 1841.
