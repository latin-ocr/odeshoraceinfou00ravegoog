ODE XXXIV.

1 wno of late but rarely trod

With careless step the path of God,
Am now constrained perforoe

To leave a speculative trech,

And thread the maze of error back
In a repentant course.

For Jove, who ost in storm hath rent

With forked fires the firmament,
Through the serene heth dn'ven

His flaming steeds and rattling yoke‚

And oleft with erashing thunderstroke
Th’ unolouded arch of Hoeven.

The brute earth quakes‚ o'ercome with dread,
Old Oeeen shrinks within his bed,

The heights of Atlas nod 3
The shades that throng the Stygian stream
confess vvith avve the power supreme

Of an avenging God.
