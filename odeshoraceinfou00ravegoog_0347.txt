ODE XVII.

ΤΟ AELIUS Lama.

AEnum, from ancient Lamus sprung
(Who first Campania’s hills among
Founded the Formian walls of old,
And used in sovereign right to hold
Those fertile traots where Liris pours
His stream upon Marica's shores),
Unless yon oroahing raven's throat

Deoeive me with its boding note,
To-morrow's rising sun shall see

The shattered limbs os many a tree,
When the wild tempest whirling by
Tumultuous from the Eastern shy
Shall strip the leaves and· strew the strand
With tangled weed and drifted sand.
Now while 'tis dry, fetoh in the store
Of fuel ready at your door ;
To-morrow you may oheer your soul
With humpers from the genial bowl,
And feast on chine of fatted porh,
Releasing all your slaves from work.

oa. 20, 1s51.
