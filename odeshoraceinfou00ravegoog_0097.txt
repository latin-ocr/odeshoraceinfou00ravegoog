While from the world sequestered far,
And safe from Sirius' seorching ster,
Thou 'lt sweetly on thy Teian string,
Penelope and Circe sing.

And here, beneath my spreading vine,
Shalt quaff the hermless Lesbinn wine,
And a far happier life shelt lead,

From dread of jealous Cyrus freed,
Lest* with intemperate hand he tear
The ehaplet from thy golden hair.

G. B.
