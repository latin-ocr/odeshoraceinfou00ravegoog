Vhtue, despising vulgar fame,
Repudiates Phraates'* claim

To happiness, although the Lord

Of Cyrus’ wealth and crown restored ;

She gives her kingdom and her throne,
And burel-meeth to him alone

Who can with steadfast eye behold,
Yet oovet not huge heaps of gold.

¹⁸ Phraates, to whom tho Parthian monarchy was restored
by Angustus, seems to have been a bod man, and was especi-
ally odions to those who had espoused the cause oi Pompey.

OBSERVATIONS.

In this Ode Crispus Sallustius is commended by Horaoo
for his right sense oi the nse os riohes 3 oi the dutiae, as well
as oi the n'qhts oi property.

He gives one or two sharp outs at covetonsness and luxury3
and winds up with a moral sentiment respecting tho only true
dignity whioh is rocognised by Vintue.

May, 1841.
