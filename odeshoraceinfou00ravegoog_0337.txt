ODE XV.

Δ ro cnroors.

er of the neody Ibycus,

Cease from these courses infament,
And fix at length some bounds to sin,
Howe’er it good thino heart within.
With one foot in tho gravo forboar
The virgins' youthful sports to share,
Like a dull envious cloud that mars
The radianoe of the glowing stars.
That which hesooms young Pholot,
Oh, Chloris, is a shame to thee!

Thy child, forsooth, may storm the door
Of gay gallants, and donce before

The throng of Bacchanals that come
With timbrels' olang and roll of drum3
· For she, inspirod by Nothus' love,
With wanton gestures learns to move
