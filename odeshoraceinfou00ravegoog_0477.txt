ODE XII.

TO VIRGIL.

Now blows the gentle Thracian breeze,
Herald of spring, to calm the fleas

And fill the flowing sails3
The fields are stiff with frost no more,
Nor do the snow-fed torrents roar

Impetuous down the valea.

The swallow builds her nest of clay,
And seems to mourn with plaintive lay

. Young Itys’ cruel fate—

0f Cecrops’ house the curse and bane,
For that too savage vengeanee ta’en
On royal lust and hate.
