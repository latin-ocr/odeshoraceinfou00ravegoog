TO FAUNUS.

On Faunus, eager to embracc

The flying Nymphs who dread thy face,
Approach in gentle moed,

And spare the firstlings of my flocks

That browse among these sunny rocks,
And cnop the springing wocd.

Then at thy shrine a tender hid

In each year’s sall shall duly bleed,
Nor shall the genial bowl

Grateful to Venus be fcrgot,

While from the altar steaming hot
Rich clouds of incense roll. ,

The flocks and herds on grassy lea
Are seen to gambol‚ when tc thee
Returns December gwy,
Freed from the yoke each happy steer
From labour freed the villager
Relax in idle play.
