TO LEUCONOE.

Snnn not too euriously what end
The Gods‚ Leuconoe, for us intend,
Nor strive to unrnvel Fate’s decree
By aid of Babyloninn sorcery3
Far better patiently our share
Of evil and of good to bear,
Whether it please Almighty Jove
To grant us length of life,
Or early to remove
Our being from this world of strife,
Soon as the ‘winter winds shall eease to roar,
And dash the ocean-ware upon the Tusean
shore.
If thou art wise, let lingering hope
Resign her place to present mirth :
F ill high the wine-sup, freely ope
Eaeh source of happiness on earth !
E'en as we speak, invidious time rolls on,
Colch, catch the fleeting hour, ere youth and
health be gone!
