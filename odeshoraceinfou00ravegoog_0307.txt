284 renones or nornen soon m.

Yet elose thy door betimes3 and when
That weiling flute is heard again,

Baek from thy lattiee haste 3
And though he eall thee eold and hard,

still keep the shutter firmly barr’d,
Inexorably chasse.

OBSERVATIONS.

In this Ode he endeavours to sllay the anxiety and eahn
the jeelonsy of Asterie during the absence of her husband
Gyges, who remains constant and true in spite of the tempt-
ations to which he had been exposed during his compulsory
delay in a distant see-port. Τὴθ sudden transition to herself,
and Horaee’s emphatic cantion to bewsre os her handsome
young neighbour Enipeus, make an sdroib and admirable
diversion to her fretfulness and solicitude.

March, 1851.
