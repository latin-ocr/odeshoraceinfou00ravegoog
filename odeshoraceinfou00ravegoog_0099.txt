ODE XVIII.

ΤΟ VARUS.

OVnnns! be the vine thy favoured tree

Around the walls of fertsse Τ ivoli ;

By wine alone weak mortale gain the power

To banish sorrow from each fleeting hour.

For who of war or poverty eonrplainS,

When Bacchus and bright Venus warm his veins?

But that discretior] mingle with the bowl,

And hid us pause ere frenzy shake the soul‚

The Centaur’s outrage at the bridal feast,

Where lust and fury fired eaoh drunken guest,

And barbarous ThracianS, maddening as they
share

Th' intemperate orgies‚ warn us to beware!

Not thuS, O Bacchus! do I court thy power,

Or woo thee reeling in the noontide honr ;

Keep thy profaner rites for such as love

The mystio gloom of Berecynthian grove,
Where sels-Love blindly wends his devious way,
Vain-Glory boastful of his fancied sway,

And Faith that learns a secret only to betray.

Jon. 1841.
