Seu Libra, seu me Scorpius aspicit
FormidolosuS, pars violentior
Natalis horae, seu tyrannus

Tutela Saturno refulgens
Eripuit, volucrisque Fati
Tardavit alas, cum populus frequens
Laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum:
Me trrmcus illapsus cerebro
¹ Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset, Mercurialium
Custos virorum. Reddere victimas

AEdemque votivam memento ε

OBSERVATIONS.

The vehement attachment professed in this Ode by the
poet to his patron, received a striking confirmation in aster
days by the fact that Horace only survived Maecenas three
veeks. He pleases himself by thinking that his own destiny
is closely linked with that os his beloved friend :-

“ Utrumque nostrum incredibili modo
Consentit astrum ;‘'

and he refers with gratitude to Heaven to the signal deliver-
ance which each had lately experienced from accident and from
discsse. He concludes byrecommending sacrifice to the Gods3
very liberal on the part of Meuanas, and (more suo) thrifty *for
himself.
