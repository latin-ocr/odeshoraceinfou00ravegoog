Oh! thou that wak'st with dulcet lute

A swan-like music in the mute,

Goddess whose heavenly finger flings

A magio o’er the golden strings,

Thine is the gift, thet in my way

The pointing myriads' homage pay,

That glad the passing Romen views

The minstrel of the Romen Muse.

From thee, the breeth that sweetens mine,

And if I plesse, the preise is thine.
H. V.
