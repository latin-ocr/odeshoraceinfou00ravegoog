456 nun onus ou nonucu. Boou 1

The guardicns of the woolly sheep

Stretched on the grass sweet concert keep
Of flutes with varied trills3

And chaun the God who haunto the groveS,

The'God who tends the flock, and loves
Arcadia’s purple hills.

The seoson brings on days of drowth 3
And, virgil, would you tacte the growth
Of rich Calenian vine,
Ο favoured guest of many a Lord,
To buy the draught you can afford,
And pay with nard the wine.

A little jar of nard’s perfume
Shall brooch the ccsk which now finds roorn
In the Sulpician store3

Ο1 power to roise emotions rare,
create new hopes, ond‚say to Care,
“ Torment me now no more.”¹

But if you mean such joyo to toste,
Produce your merchandize, und haste
. To truck and trade with me:
i Not like the wealthy and the great
Do I intend to stand the trent,

And give you liquor free.
