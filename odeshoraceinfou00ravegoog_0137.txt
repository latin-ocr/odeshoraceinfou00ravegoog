ODE XXX.

TO VENUS.

ΟΗ, Queen of Paphos! Goddess bright,

Leave thy belovbd isles, and come
Where clouds of incense thee invite,
Το Glycera's congenial home.

Let cupid with thee haste and bring
The Graces‚ with unfettered zone,

And Mercury, and Nymphs of Spring,
And Youth without thee dull and lone.

Feb. 1841.
