And would that foes alone should feel

These storms when sight and senses reel
And clouds and billows mingle3

The rising Auster’s wild commoneo,

The roaring of the troubled ocean,

And waves that lash the shingle.

So when Europa dared confide

Her heaving breast and snowy side
To the deceitful Steer,

Pale she surveyed the hlue profound

While sea-born monsters wallowing round
Amid the surf appear.

She who of late in meadows green

Among her sister nymphs was seen
Gath'ring the vernol flowers,

Can now behold no object, save

The silver stars and rippling wave
ln cloudy twilight’s hours.

Who when she touched the shore of Crete

Where hundred citios hold their seat,

“ Oh father‚” thus the damsel oried‚

“ Oh name, aud filial duty all beliad,

“ What rege, what frenzy overoame

“ My maiden feam, my maidon shame!

“ Whence have Ι come, or whither wend?
“ Death only ean my sorrows end,

“ But far too light a penalty

“ For such transgression ’twere to die!
