ΤΟ AUGUSTUS CAESAR.

huonon of snow end hail the sire

Of Gods heth caused on earth to fall,
Darting with red right hand his fire

At Rome's devoted Capitol.

The trembling nations saw, and feerod
Lest Pyrrha's age should come again,

When Proteus drove his finny herd
To mountains merged beneeth the main.

Thon fishes struggled 'mid the boughs
Where late the wooddove built her nest,

And stege upreared their ontlered brows
Above the whelming billow's orest.

We saw the swellen Tiber whirled
Book from the steep Etruscan shore,

Saw columns from their bases hurled,
And Vesta's temple floated o'er3
