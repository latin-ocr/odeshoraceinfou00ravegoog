ODE XV.

THE PROPHECY OF Nareae.

As o'er the seas the faithlees Phrygian boy
His beauteous partner bore to Troy,
The winds were hushed‚ and from the main
Prophetic Nereus sang in melancholy 11111111-
“ Thou bearest her home in evil hour,
“ Whom to renovet, Graeoia's power,
“ Begfrt with sword and helm,
“ To break thy nuptiale shall conspire‚
“ And desolate with steel and fire
“ Proud Priam’s ancient 1611111.
“ Alae 1 what troops of men and horse
“ Unite to swell the invading force 1
“ What hosts of Trojan heroes slain
“ Shall rot upon Dardania’s plain !
‘⁶ Indignant Pallae o'er the field
“ Rattles her sounding car, and shakes her
blazing shield.
‘⁶ Vainly on Venus’ care relying,
‘⁶ Thou oombest thy golden hair3
· “ And warblest, in thy ohamber lying‚
“ From death and danger meanly flying,
“ Love·ditties to 1116 fair.
