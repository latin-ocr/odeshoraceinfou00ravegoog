Who governs still his native woodo
In Lycia's mountain solitude8‚
And still bestows his fav'ring smile
On Patara ond Delos' Isle 1
Brute violence exhausts itself in vain 3
well-ordered force the Gods sustain
And still promote, although they hate
² The pride of strength that doth ull crimes create.
Truths such as these let Gyas prove
With all his hundred arms errayed 3
And wild Orion’s lawless love
Tumed by thy shnst, ehoste Huntreos Maidl
Heaped on her progeny‚ the Earth
Grieves for her own portentous birth ;

Who soorehed with lurid lightning groon,
Deep in the gulf of Acheron.
Still Etna vomits uneonsumed

Red streame of subterraneon fine,
And Tityos' entrails still are doomed
To glut th’ insatiate vulture’s ire.
⁵ F or such dread ministers of Fote

The tortured vietim’s lust uwait3
The burthen of three hundred chains

Pirithous’ frenzied love restrains.

Fet. 1851.
