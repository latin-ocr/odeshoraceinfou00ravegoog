ODE XIV.

ΤΟ THE REPUBLIC.

(Paraphraae.)

Snrr' of the State, beware 1
New storms around thee gather 3

Tempestuous seas and driving galea,
With threatening breakers, warn thee rather
To anehor firm and reef thy sails,
Than desperately to dare
A dangerous strait untried before,
While adverse wind and tide assail the rocky
shore.

Quaen of the deep! the blast ·
Howls in the northern heaven ;
Thy splintered yards and rocking mast,
Rent sails and eordage riven‚
The irnperious wave shall scarae withstand
When, all thy moorings brohe, thou nearest the
fatal strand.
