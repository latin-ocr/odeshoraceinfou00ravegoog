Ὺ ooo X.

TO tlemus

Teme course, Licinius, would'st thou keep,
Venture not rashly o’er

The trochless desert of the deep;

Nor, shrinhing from the whirlwind’s sweep,
Τοο closely hug the shore.

Whoe'er observes the golden mean,
Enjoys a quiet home

In sweet security, between

The sordid pauper's hearth unclean,
And Grandeur's envied dome.

The stotely pine or giant ash
Most feel the tempest's shoek3

And losty towers with direr crash

Fau down, and ost the lightning’s flash
Shivers the highest rock.
