Behold, what groups of clients greet
A fourth, as passing down the street
He threads the crowd ; but Fate

Allots to each his equal share,
And Death's capacious urn shall bear
The names cf small and great.

The wretch whose guilty conscience sees
Th’ impending sword of Damocles,
N 0 sight of sumptuous feast,
Nor wassailhowl, nor lyric strain,
Nor warbling of the feathered train‚
Can ever lull tc rest.

Sleep, balmy slecp, despises not

Th’ Arcadian shepherd’s humble cot
And T empe's flowery vales ;

N or shuns the streamlet’s shady bed,

With fragrant heath and fern o'erspread‚
And rocked by vernal gales.

The man content with what he hath
Fears not the raging ocean's wrath,
Fears not the' tempest's war3
Nor trembles at the setting beam
Of wild Arcturus, nor the gleam
Of Haedus' rising star:
