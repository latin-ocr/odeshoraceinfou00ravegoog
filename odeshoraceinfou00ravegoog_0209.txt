ODE XI.

TO QUINCTIUS mamus.

anecmna Hmnmns! pray forbear
Το fret me longer with the thought
Of aught the Scythian meditatae, or aught
The fierce untamed Cantabn'an may dare!
Since between us and these the wild waves roan
· Incessant on the Hadriatic shore3
And life, which nceds but little, sure may spare
Her momente such unprofitable care.
Soon will the grace of youth be fled;
And stem old age, with tresses grey‚
0 Will quickly baniah from our bed
Light easy sleep and amorous play:
For change is Nature’s rule; the flowcr
That bloomed at sunniae fades at noon,
And¹ varies with each varying hour
The semblance of the silver moon. ·
Why with ctemal counsels tire the mind,
For change and circumstance alike designed?
