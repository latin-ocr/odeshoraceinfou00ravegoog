ODE VII.

TO As'rnmn.

Nnr cease, Asterie, to complain3

Fair vernn] galee shall bring again
Thy wanderer from the sea,

Gyges-dein object of thy cares,

Made wealthy with Bithyninn waren,
And ever true to thee.

Though now beneath th' inclement heaven,
By adverse wind and planet driven,

He seeks Epirus' coast ;
Not without tears to pass the night
Sleepless and cold, a lonely wight,

By love and fortune crost.

Yet ae he lingere norm-stain there,
Some ely, time-serving messenger,
Tells how his hostess burne

Thy spouse's constaney to prove ;
And smit with unrequited love,
Complnins and sighs by turns.
