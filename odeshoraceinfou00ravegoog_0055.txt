30 TER onis os nosses. BOOK 1.

Who may describe the wild almus,

Of Mars in adamantius arms?

Or sing in fitting strain and just

Of Merion black with Trojan dust?

Or Diomed in combat made

A match for Gods by Pallas’ aid?

My song shall be the feast and dance,
Youth's joy and maiden’s petulance,
And virgin's warfars who assails

Τοο bold advance with sharpened nails,

Whether by love inflamed or free,
Fickle as is my wont to be.

OBSERVATIONS.

Gesner says, that in this Ode Horace, “ adhuc Semi-
Pompeianus‚'' ingeniously excuses himself from complying
with the wishes of M. Agrippa, son-in-law os Augustus
that he should write an heroic poem on the civil war. i
Certainly no one could have framed a more graoeful i

apology.

Jan. 1836.
