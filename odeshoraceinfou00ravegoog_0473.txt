ODE XI.

ne nunnus.

Parme, a cash of Alban wine

Awaits thee, numhering summers nine3
And parsley in my garden grows,
Luxuriant herb, to crown thy brows‚

Or ivy green in clusters rare,

To bind with wreaths thy flowing hair.
With silver plate the parlour shines‚
And vervain chaste the altar mines,
Which soon a lamb's life-blood shall stain
Young vistim waiting to be slain.

The house is in a bustle ε here

Run serving·boys‚ and damsels there,
And from the kitnhen blazing bright
The smoke ascende in columns white.
Ask you what mean such revels here?
Bright April's meny Ides are near3
This day the verna] month divides

O’er which the sea-bo'rn Queen presides,
A solemn festival most dear

To me of all the circling year3
