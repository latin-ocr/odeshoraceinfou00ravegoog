OBSERVATIONS.

In thie Ode Horace has confert-ed immortality upon a
fountain‚ the precise locality 01 which was long a subject 01
doubt and controversy. The discovery 01 a Bull 01 Pope
Pascal ΙΙ., an. 1103, first brought to notice by Capmartin
de Cheupy in his work on “ Horace's country House” (vol.
iii. pp. 864, 538), seems 10 settle the question. The Ban-
dusien Fount was not on the Sabine Fam, as all the carly
commentatore supposed, but was near the town 01 Venusia in
Apulia, Horace’s birthplace.

There was a monastery dedicated to tho Virgin at Bantia,
over which the Bull appoints a certain Α1101, and over
“omnia quea ad Caenobium pertinent” (scilicet inter alia)
“Ecclesiam SS. Martyrum Gervasii et Protesii iu Bandu-
siae fonte aprtd Ventorum.”-Vide Oapmartin de chaum, vol.
iii. pp. 364, 538.

This “ short and sweet’' Ode was the Author’s first attempt
at English hanelation in this work.

1819.
