Theu asseiled her strichen soul
Frenzied with the wssssil bowl
Terrore true, end wild despair,
When (ss seleon from sbove
Pounees on the timorous dove,
Or hunters chese o‘er Haemou’s snow the here)

Osr end ssil incessant plying,

As he marked her gulleys flying,
Caeser urged her hesdloug rsee:
Deeming thet his wondrous prize

soon should glsdden Romen eyes,
And bound in chains his huughty triumph grues.

N obly she to desth resigned,
“ Not with womsn‘s shrinking mind,

Gezed upon the desdly knife;
Nor within some friendly ereek
Besely lurking, did she seek
To save from death s now dishononred life.

On her prostrate Citsdel
Dured her dsuntless eye to duell:
Firm ol purpose, culm she stood,
Holdiug with unlliuehing grssp
To her bresst applied the usp,
Whose venem dire she drsnk through ull her blood.

Sternly resolute she died ς
Nor eould stoop her royel pride, ¹
Thou, reserved to swell s show,
She s Womsn sud s Queen,
Should be led like captive mesu
Through streete of Remoto grece her eonquering foe.
