ODE XXVIII.

ARGHYTAS.

“ Pmcn to thy shade, Archytas l-Thee‚
‘⁴ The measurer of earth and sea,

“ The rite unpaid of sprinlded send
“ Confines upon the Metine strand.

‘⁴ All in vain thy soaring soul

“ Surveyed the spheres from pole to pole,-
“ All in vain thine eagle eye
“ Explored the bounds of earth and sky;
‘⁴ Fate hath stopped thy galley’s prow,
“ Deeth hath laid thy triumphs low !”
“ Scomer, cease thy gibing breath !
“ Who hath 'scaped the dart of Death?
“ Tithonus borne to realms above,
“ Minos, the confidant of Jove,
“ And Pelops' sire, who held his state
“ With Gods, have all succumbed to Fate!
