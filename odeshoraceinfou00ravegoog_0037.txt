Mare, whom the clash of sword and lance
And cries of savage strife delight‚

And the fierce soldier's fiery glauce
Flcshcd at his foeman in the fight :-

Or like a youth of mortal state,

Winged Sonos Maia, come thou down3
Avenger thou of Caesar's fate,

Inheritor of Caesar‘s crown!

Late be thy parting hence, and long
Reign 0’er the country of thy birth!

Nor let disgust of public wrong
Abridge thy destined term on carth.

Pursue thy mighty triumphs here,
Bc called our Father and our King3

And over rebel Media bear
The Roman Eagle’s conquering wing.

OBSERVATIONS.

This Ode contains many fine and spirited stanneo, but
the meaning herc and there is extremely obscure, and the
adulation os Augustus most fulsomc and extravagant. To
invest the Emperor with the divine attributeS, and even
personalities, of Apollo, VenuS, Mure, and Mercury‚ in suc-
cessim, seems to surpass ull bounds of poetical license ond
courtly edulation. Yet one cannot too much admire the
ingenuity with which all these compliments are centred in

¹ Augustus in the two concluding stanzas.

Dec. 1835.
