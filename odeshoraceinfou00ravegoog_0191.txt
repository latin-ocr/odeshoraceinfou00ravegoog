Jove to this fair and favoured spot

Gives wintere mild and springs benign,
And Aulon’s vineyards envy not

The produce of Falernian vine. ἱ

These happy hills await us 1 here,

When Horace meets his final doom,
Thy tribute of a friendly tear¹
Shall consecrate the Poet's tomb.

OBSERVATIONS.

This little Ode is full of feeling, and breatheo the strongest
attachment to a favoured locality. We are reminded of the
concluding lines by those of Scott's well-known apostrophe to
Caledonia in tho introductory stannes ol the oth (lanto of
“ The Lay of the Last Minstrel :’'—

‘⁸ By Yarrow·a stream still let rne ancy,
Though none shall guido my feeble way ;
Still feel tho breezo from Ettrick break,
Although it chill my wither-ed oheek3
still lay my hand by Tariot otono,
Thongh there lorgottan ond alono
Tho Bard may draw hia parting groan!¹
