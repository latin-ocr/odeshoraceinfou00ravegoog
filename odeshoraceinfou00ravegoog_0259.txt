Although his vines be smit with hail,

Although his promised harvests fail
And mock the labourer’s toil;

Although his drooping trees complain

Of pinching frost, or drenching rain,
Or drought that burns the soil.

Then let the proud earth's bounds disdain,

And stretch their empire o'er the main3
Hither come lord and slaveS,

Hither the bold contractors 001110,

And casting piers athwart the foam,
Enchain the subject waves.

But 1011, and Τ1110110, and swelling Rage,
Are seen to mount the sels-same stage
Of all this pomp and power 3
Care climbs the lofty barge's sideS,
Care the fleet courser’s croupe bestn‘deS‚
Embittem‘ng every honr.

If purple robes and jewels fine,

If marble from the Phrygian mine
Engraved with choicest art ;

If the Falernian vintage rare,

And Achaemenian unguents ne’er

Can soothe an aching heart3
