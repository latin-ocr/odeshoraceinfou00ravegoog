358 nnn onns on nomon. noon 111.

1n spirit thus 1 seem to rove

By river bank ond pathless grove.

O Thou, who rul'st the Naind quire,

And dost thy worshippers inspiro

With strength to rend the oaks in twain

Uptorn and prostrate on the plain!

No vulgar hymn nor mortal strain

Shnll swell thy chornl orison-

A pleasing frenzy fires me on

To join thy jocund train,

God of the wine-prese styled! whose ringlets shine
With purple grapes enwreathed, and tendrils of the vine.

OBSERVATIONS.

This Odo is a real rhapsody‚ probably inspired by the God
to whom itis addressed. It is however fullos poetry, ond
more pictoresque in its imogery than almost any os our an·

thor's productione, not nnlike what o. Roman Walter Soott
might have written.
