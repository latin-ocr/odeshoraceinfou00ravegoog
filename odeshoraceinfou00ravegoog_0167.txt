ODE XXXVIII.

TO HIS SLAVII.

I ms these Persian fopperies, oh, Boy!
These artifieisl gerlande I contemn3
Forbear for such vain purpose to destroy

The last sweet rose that lingers on hIs stem.

I will not that such tesk employ thee, save
The glossy myrtle’s s‘rmple sprig to twine3
Nor shall the myrtle misbecome my slave
Nor me, reclined beneath the spreading vine.
