And if I send such offerings forth,

Ι boldly vouch my present’s worth.
Not statues upon columns raised,

Nor tombs at public cost emblazed,

By which great leaders after death
Receive anew both life and breath,

Not Carthage blaaing in her fall,

N or the fierce threats of Hannibal ‚
Hurled bach upon himself, such fame
Have heaped on Scipio's lofty name,-
(The name triumphant which he bore
From 'ancient Afric’s conquered shore,)
As that Calabrian Muse* which shed
Immortal glory round his head.

lf verse be silent, where’s the meed

Of noble aim, or virtuous deed?

Where should we seek the son of Mara,
Of yore translated to the stars,

If envious silence cast her gloom ι

On him who founded mighty Rome?
The songs of gifted Bards redeem
Great AEacus from Lethe's stream2

To hold his state where summer smiles
Perpetual on th’ Elysian Isles

The brave and good can never die,

The Muse transfers them to the sky,

* “ Calabriau Musc,” Ennius.
