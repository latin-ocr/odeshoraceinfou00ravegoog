ODE XVII.

ΤΟ MAEcENAs.

MMENAS! why distract me with this sear?
Nor to the Gods, nor me, doth it appear
A just decree that thou, the prop

And pride of all I have, or hope,

Shouldst go before me to the tomb!

Alas! alas! if such a doom

should tear away the better part

Of my bereaved and yearning heart,

Why should I linger here, no more
Dear to myselfi surviving thee!

Ah, no Ι if come it must, that hour
A double sacrifice shall see.

No simulated love this heart bestowffi
These lips have uttered no perfidious vows;
I go, I go where'er thou lead’st the way,
Nor Death itself my progress shall delay.
Neither Chimaera’s breath of flame,

Nor hundxed-handed Gyges’ frame,

My lot from thine shall separate,—

For so ’tis willed by J ustice and by Fate.
