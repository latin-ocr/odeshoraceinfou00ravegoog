·ODE VII.

ΤΟ TORQUA'I'US.

Tm winter snows have fied, the grassy leo
Grows green and foliage decks the tree;

Eerth feels the change, within their hanks the rills
Diminished trickle from the hills ;

With zone unbound, the N ymphs and Graces dare
Το frolic in the vernol air.

Do thou take waming from the fleeting year,
Nor hope for joys immortal here.

spring comes, the zephyrs thaw the frozen glade,
And summer follows soon to fade ;

Brown Autumn sheds his ripened fruit, and then
The sluggish winter comes again.

Yet in this changeful system, loss is soon
Repaired hy each revolving moon ;

Herein destruction heth no lasting power,
While we frail heings of an hour

When once we sink into the greedy grave
Which swullows up clike the hrave,

The rich, the poor, the mighty, end the just,
Moulder in ashes end in dust.
