ODE XXVII.

ΤΟ ms COMPANIONS.

Lar aavage Thracians disagree‚
And threaten o'er their wine3

Renounee sueh barbarous practice, ye
That would be friends of mine,

And banish from the genial bowl .
All menaea and revilings foul.

Το this bright board abhorrent gleams
The Madian seymitar,
And all intolerable seems
The atrise of wordy war:
O foolish hoya, your elamour eeaae, ·
And rest upon your eoueh in peace!

Will ye that Ι my share should take
Of hot Falernian? Well,

A friend of me, and tell
What amorous wound has caused his smart,

Then let Megilla's brother make ἱ
What shaft has pierced his bleeding heart?
