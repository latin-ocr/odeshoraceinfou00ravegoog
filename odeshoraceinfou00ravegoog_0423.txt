400 nnn onns on noanon. soon 1v.

Be thina, my fiiend, the task to sing

Great Caesar's praise on bolder string
Returning from the wart

When laurel-vvreaths adorn his brovv,

And fierce Sicambrian captives bow
Behind the victor's car;

Than whom the F ates and kindly Heaven

Greater or better ne'er have given,

Nor will again, though vve behold

Renewed on earth the age of gold.

Be thine to sing these festal days,

The city‘s joy, and public playa,

And bid the Forum's squabblcs cease

When brave Augustus brings us peace.

Then (if in aught my voice avail)

That voice shall join with thine to hail

The glorious sun, th’ auspicious monn

That welcome Caesar's glad return ;

Ho Triumph, hol see the pomp advances!

Ηο Triumph, ho ἔ mark the festal danaes 1

Nor we alone shall swell the cry,

But the whole city shall reply,

And see the votive altars risa

With incense flaming to tho skies.

Ten lordly bulls, as many cows,

Iulus, shall absolve thy vows3
