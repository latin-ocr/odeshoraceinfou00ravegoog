ODE XVIII.

Mr humble dwelling boasts no rich arcade,
With ivory panelled, and with gold o'erlaid 3
Nor Libyan columns prop the architraves
Of sculptured marble from Hymettus’ caves 3
Nor do I venture, as a doubtful heir,

The wealth or throne of Attalus to share ;

Nor do my olients' honest wives outspread

For me the mantle of Laconian red.

Yet here Contentment brings a hindly vein

Of mirth and wit3 nor do the rich disdain

My humble home: why then should Ι complain,
Or kneel a suppliant at some patron’s door,

Or weary Heaven to grant a larger storo?

Time rolla his course ; each morning leads to noon,
Revolving months behold their changing moon,
Whilet thou, oblivione of the fleeting honr,

Art founding now a palaoe at threescore3

And halting upon life's extremest vorge,

Art wont with age’s petulanoe to urge
Enoroaohments stretehing o’er th' Ausonian main,
Dirpleased on Baiae's cliffs and N aples plain.
