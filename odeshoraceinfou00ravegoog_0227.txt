Tn’ Imperial works in progress now
Leave but few aeres for the plough3
And in the depths between
A mighty space huge {ish-ponds take
Extensive aethe Luerine lake3
And here and there a sereen

Of barren plane-trees stands arrayed‚
Conquering the elm's vine-mantled shade;
Then violet-bede, andan
The breathing scente that Flora loves,
Deck the once fruitful olive-groves
Now nodding to their fall.

And lumel-bowers exclude the ray
Of Phoebus through -the sultry day:
Not such the precepta told
Of Romulus, and the Stoie rule
Of bearded Cato, and the school
Of legislation old.
