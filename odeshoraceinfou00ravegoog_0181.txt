ODE IV.

TO XANTHIAS PHOCEUS.

Mr Xanthias! never be ashamed

To bow before a haudmaid’s charms;
Remember how Briseis tamed

Achilles, terrible in arms ;

And how a Phrygian captive moved
The heart of Ajax Telamon 3

How royal Agamemnon loved
A ravished maidby conquest won ;

When the barbarian cohorte bled
Before the fierce Thessalian's blowa
And Troy was lest, her Hector dead,

An easier prey to wearied foes.

Perhaps some noble sire may claim

The slave through whom you sear disgrace3
Perhaps she mourns a tainted name,

A friendless home, a royal raca.
