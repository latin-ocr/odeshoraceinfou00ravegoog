Punnncn. XV

In conclusion, I desire to express my
thanhs to those friends in particular from

whose critical acumen l hope ιο have derived

some advantage, as Ι have certainly received ,

much encouragement. First to my accom-
plished relative, the Dean of Christchurch,
than whom few men will be found more
competent ιο pronounce a verdict upon any
classical composition3 secondly, ιο my old
and excellent friend, the Rev. W. N. Darnell,
Rector of Stanhope ;' and thirdly‚ to the Ven.
R. C. Cone, Archdeacon of Lindisfarne.

Το the criticisms of these most competent

scholars I have generally deferred‚ since by

l such deference l testify the greater apprecia- Ι

· tion of their favourable opinions.

F inally‚ when l mention that in this work t

will be found spirited and accurate versions ξ

of two Odes from a much abler pen than
mine, I feel how much the value of my book
will he enhanced in public estimation by
these examples of the poetical talent of that
noble and accomplished Earl, whose eloquent

voice is so olten heard with admiration within
