Parnon mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum
tabernas
Regumque turres. Ο beate Sexti,
Vitae summa brevis spem nos vetat inchoare
longam.
J am te premet nox fabulaeque manes,
Et domus exilis Plutonia3 quo simul menos,
Nec regna vini sortiere tolie,
Nec tenerum Lycidan mirabere, quo calet
juventus

N une omnis, et mox virgines tepebunt.

Ouennvarlous (continued).

bnt ‘⁴ fugit''-meaning that Vuleon, burning with love, had
desened his shop. Thus in another Ode we lind ’

“Quirinus
Martis equis Acherontesuyit.''
But this is mere conjecture, and not wananted hy any an-
thority. The word ‘⁴ risit'’ seems lo exist in some ol the oldest
manuscripts-“ urit ’' hus given rise to many odd speculatione
of the commentatore. One “ learned Theban,” styled Torren-
tius, has imagined that, muse thunderstorms are frequent
in spring, Vuleau felt obliged to be doubly active in forging
thunderbolts, lest they should not come to hand when Jove
required! And the erudite “ Cruquius’' hus indulged in still
more recondite speculatione as to the meaning of “ officinas,”
which the curione reuder may find among the “ variorum”
notes—For obvious reasons, I have sbridged und generalised
the concluding linos ol this pretty Ode.

Moy, 1835.
