Rege wrought Thyestes' overthrow,
And cities‚ mighty in their time,
sad record bear of roge and crime,
Which laid their glories desolate,
When hostile armico, in their hate,
Drove o'er their levelled walls the plough,
And ruined palaces and fanos
Encumbered the deserted ploins.
Calm thou thy mind! and if ere now
Το me youth’s fervour and the glow
Of passion in my ewelling veins ’
Have dictated reproachful struice,
Henceforth let gentler themes employ
’ My heart and tongue: whilst thou, serene,
With open brow and placid mien,
shalt pass thy future days with joy ;
Nor poison still the cup of life
With bitter words of frequent strife,
But bid unjust reproaches cease,
And give me back domestic peace.

Noc. 1830.
