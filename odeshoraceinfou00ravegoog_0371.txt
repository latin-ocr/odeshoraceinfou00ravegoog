ODE XXIV.

Tnouefl you possessed all India’s gold,
And all Arabia’s wealth untold‚
Though you begim with solid quays
The Tyrrhene ond th' Apulian sees,

If iton-handed Destiny

Her irreversible deeree

Against your peloso-roof shall plant,
And fix with hails of adamant,

No em shall rid your troubled mind
From Cere and Fear that lurks behind,
No refuge for your head be found

By suares of Death encompessed round.
Better the Nomod Scythian's lot

Who moves about his wandering cot
On waggons drawn from spot to spot 3—
And Gete’s hardy sons, fo whom

The boundless desem gives a home,
And aeres of unmeasured plain

Supply with stores of golden grain3

While none expende upon the soil
More than one year’s continuous toil,
And each successor olaims no more
Than he who formed the erop before.
