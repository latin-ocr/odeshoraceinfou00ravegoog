ons mn. Q. noasru rusccr chamus. 463

Quo fugit Venus? heu! quove color? decens
Quo motus? quid habes illius, illius,
Quae spirabat amores,
' Quae me surpuerat mihi,
Felix post Cinaram, notaque et artium
Gratarum facies? sed Cinarae breves
Annos fata dederunt,
Servatura diu parem
Cornicis vetulae temporibus Lycen 3
Possent ut juvenes visere fervidi,
Multo non siue risu',
Dilapsam in eineres facem.

OBSERVATIONS.

In this savage Ode Horace arenges himself upon Lyce sor
her former coldness and disduiu. Iu such spiteful effusione as
these we forget the gentle and amiable temper which usually
characterises the Poet‚ aud cau hardly believe that the same
haud should hara peuned such eruel reproaches. We no
longer recognise that pleasing pertrait drawn by Persius :-

⁴⁸ Omne veser vilium ridenti Haacus amieo
Tangit et admissus emaum precordia ludit”

We regret aud almost reseut the change.
Oue passage alone :-

“ Quo sugit Venus heu!'' dae.

is suggestire of his former affection, aud seems to revise in

his oold heart a passing reminiscenda of what Lyae was iu her
youthful days.
