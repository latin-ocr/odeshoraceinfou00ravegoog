ODE XIII. .

TO LYDIA.

Wnnn thou, Ο Lydia, praisest thus
The youthful bloom of Telephus,

His rosy neck and waxen anns,

What jealousy my soul alarms!

N ο certain form my thoughts retain,-
My colour flies, then comes again3 “
And tears that ruah unbidden prove
The pange of unregarded love.

I burn to see thy shoulders white
Deformed by his intemperate spite,

Or where thy lips in frenzied joy
Were pressed by the impassioned boy.
Oh, dream not, Lydia, that auch love
Constant like mine can ever prove!
And shun that aweet, but barb'rous kiae,
Which Venus steeps in treble bliss.
Thrice happy those united minds
Whom love in linha unbroken binde,-
Love that defies each fretful breath—
Leve that can only end with death!

Jaly 1836.
