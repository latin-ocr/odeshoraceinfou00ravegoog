THE ODES OT HORACE. BOOK 1.

The merchant on th' Icarian sess
wind-bound and tost‚ regrets the ease
And gardens of his native town3

But soon once more, the storm o'erblown,
Refits his shattered fleet and braves‚

At luere's call, the foaming waves.

The sons of luxury incline

To quaff the bowl of purple wine,

And snatch a portion of the day

To while the vacant hours away,

Where myrtles shade the noontide beam
Beside a consecrated stream.

Many of sternar mould there are

Whom camps delight and horrid war
By mothers hated, and the strain

Of elarions on the battle-plain.

The hunter, scorning dull repose,
Pursues his game through wintry snows
And careless of his tender wife

Expecta with glee the dangerous strife,
Whether his bloodhounds snuff the drag

Of timid hind or antlered stag,
Or the rude boar hath burst his net

About the Marsian coverts set.

Upon my learned brows be shown,
Envied by gods, the ivy crown3

To me, distinguished from the throng,
Cool grots and shady groves belong,
