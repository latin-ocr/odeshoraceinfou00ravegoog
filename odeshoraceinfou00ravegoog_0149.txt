His sovereign pleasure can abase
The proud, and can the humble place
In posts of power and trust3
The mandate His, when giddy chance
Appear our fortunes to advance,
Or crumble them to dust.

OBSERVATIONS.

In this remarkable Ode, Horace recorda his conversion
from a careless lise to a sense of religious duty by having
witnessed the phenomenon of a flash of lightning in a serene
and cloudless shy. In all probability this was the fall of an
aerolite or meteorie stone.

A near relative os mine, distinguished in the annals ol

diplomacy, told me that he witnessed a similar occurrence in
Italy on a joumey between Florence and Pisa, when a tre-
mendons explosion took place in a perfectly serene sky, and a
bolt, “ nn hilmine‚” as the Italians termed it, fell close to the
road within a short distance. On examining the spot the
ground was ploughed up, and the stone (if stone it were)
had probably buried itself beneath the surface, which was still
smoking.

Itis well known that some os these marvellons productione
have been precipitated to the earth of a prodigious size.

Their existence and peculiar formation are still a problcm to
philosophers.
